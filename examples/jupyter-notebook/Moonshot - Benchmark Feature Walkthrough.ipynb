    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and the Moonshot framework, it's essential to set up a proper working environment. This will help in avoiding any potential conflicts with Python libraries and ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. If you haven't already created a virtual environment for this notebook, we highly recommend doing so. Here's how you can set it up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the notebook's directory: <br>\n",
    "<code> cd /path/to/notebook/directory </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a virtual environment named 'env' (or any name you prefer): <br>\n",
    "<code> python -m venv env</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   - On macOS and Linux:<br>\n",
    "   <code>bash source env/bin/activate</code>\n",
    "   - On Windows:<br>\n",
    "   <code>bash .\\env\\Scripts\\activate</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:<br>\n",
    "<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading and Setting Up the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset required for this notebook can be found in the Moonshot data repository. You will need to download it and place it into the `data` folder within the `examples/jupyter-notebook` directory. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the dataset from the Moonshot data repository:<br>\n",
    "<code>git clone https://github.com/moonshot-admin/moonshot-data.git</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Move the cloned repository's contents into the `data` folder within the `examples/jupyter-notebook` directory:<br>\n",
    "<code>mv moonshot-data/* /path_to_moonshot_directory/moonshot/examples/jupyter-notebook/data/</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to the `data` directory and install any additional requirements for the dataset:<br>\n",
    "<code>cd /path_to_moonshot_directory/moonshot/examples/jupyter-notebook/data</code><br>\n",
    "<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Preparations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure the following:\n",
    "- The virtual environment is active whenever you're working on this project.\n",
    "- All datasets and required libraries are installed within the virtual environment.\n",
    "- You have the necessary permissions to read and write within the data directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps completed, your environment is now ready for you to engage with the Moonshot framework and harness the capabilities of GPT-3.5 for advanced AI experimentation and analysis.\n"

    "## Understanding Connectors in Moonshot\n",
    "\n",
    "A `connector` in the Moonshot framework acts as an interface between the framework itself and an external AI model, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5. It is responsible for two primary functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Communication**: The connector handles all the API calls to the AI model, including sending requests and receiving responses. It abstracts the complexity of direct API interactions, providing a simple interface for the Moonshot framework to execute commands and retrieve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Processing**: Once a response is received from the AI model, the connector processes this information, translating it into a format that is usable within the Moonshot framework. This may involve parsing text, handling data structures, or extracting specific metrics from the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, connectors are customizable modules that dictate how Moonshot communicates with different AI models. They are designed to be modular, allowing developers to add support for new models or modify existing interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up an endpoint, you will select an appropriate connector that matches the AI model you wish to interact with. This ensures that the endpoint can correctly manage the flow of data to and from the model, according to the protocols and formats required by both Moonshot and the AI service provider."

    "### Connector Types and Available Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Moonshot framework, connectors define the specific methods of interaction with various AI models. To see a list of all the connectors currently available within Moonshot, we use the `api_get_all_connector_type()` function. This will enumerate the types of connectors that you can use to establish endpoints for different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each connector encapsulates two essential behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Invocation**: This defines how the Moonshot framework calls the AI model. Developers can refer to the `get_response()` async function within the connector's Python file located at `moonshot\\data\\connectors\\` to understand the specifics of making API calls to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Handling**: After receiving a response from the AI model, the connector must process this data appropriately. The `_process_response()` function within the connector's implementation is responsible for parsing and formatting the model's output so that it can be utilized effectively within the Moonshot framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we will execute `api_get_all_connector_type()` to display a list of all the available models that Moonshot can connect to through these connectors."

    "\n",
    "A cookbook in the Moonshot framework is a collection of recipes. Think of it as an anthology that groups together various tests, benchmarks, and analyses for AI models. A cookbook allows you to organize and execute multiple recipes in a structured manner, which is particularly useful when you want to evaluate a model across different dimensions or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "A cookbook typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Name**: A unique name for the cookbook.\n",
    "2. **Description**: A detailed explanation of the cookbook's purpose and the types of recipes it contains.\n",
    "3. **Recipes**: A list of recipe names that are included in the cookbook. Each recipe represents a specific test or benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a cookbook, you will use the `api_create_cookbook()` function provided by the Moonshot API. This function requires you to specify the name and description, and then you can add the recipes you have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might call this function to create a cookbook:"

    "\n",
    "The Moonshot framework enables you to run recipes, which are sets of instructions for evaluating AI models against predefined tasks and metrics. Executing recipes allows you to measure the model's performance and gain valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Recipes with `api_create_runner`\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute recipes, you can use the `api_create_runner` function, which allows for running multiple recipes on specified endpoints. This function is particularly useful for conducting parallel evaluations and comparisons across different models or configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide to running recipes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Runner**: Assign a name to your recipe runner and specify the recipes and endpoints you wish to use.\n",
    "2. **Set Execution Parameters**: Choose the number of prompts to test and other optional parameters like `random_seed` and `system_prompt`.\n",
    "3. **Advanced Configuration**: Optionally, you can customize the runner processing module and result processing module.\n",
    "4. **Execute the Recipes**: Use the runner to run the specified recipes with the given parameters.\n",
    "5. **Close the Runner**: Ensure to close the runner after execution to free up resources.\n",
    "6. **Review Results**: Access the results of the run, which include performance metrics and other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results, runners and databases are located at ```data/generated-outputs/```\n",

    "## Running a Cookbook in Moonshot\n",
    "\n",
    "A cookbook in Moonshot is a curated collection of recipes designed to be executed together. This allows for comprehensive testing or benchmarking across multiple scenarios or models. Running a cookbook is similar to running individual recipes but on a larger scale, enabling simultaneous execution of multiple tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing the Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of running a cookbook involves creating a runner, which is a task manager that handles the execution of the recipes contained within the cookbook. The runner can be configured with various parameters, such as the number of prompts to use and whether to include a system prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide to running a cookbook, as demonstrated in the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Runner**: Give your cookbook runner a name and specify the cookbooks and endpoints to use.\n",
    "2. **Set Execution Parameters**: Determine the number of prompts to test and set optional parameters like `random_seed` and `system_prompt`.\n",
    "3. **Advanced Configuration**: Optionally, adjust the runner processing module and result processing module.\n",
    "4. **Execute the Cookbook**: Use the runner to execute the specified cookbooks with the given parameters.\n",
    "5. **Close the Runner**: After execution, close the runner to ensure proper cleanup.\n",
    "6. **Review Results**: Access the results of the run, which include performance metrics and other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results, runners and databases are located at ```data/generated-outputs/```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code that implements the cookbook execution process:\n"

    "## Understanding Runners in Moonshot\n",
    "\n",
    "Runners in the Moonshot framework are the engines that drive the execution of recipes and cookbooks, as well as facilitate red teaming sessions. They orchestrate the interaction between the Moonshot framework and AI models, managing the flow of data and ensuring that tests are carried out according to the specified parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of Runners\n",
    "\n",
    "A runner acts as a versatile task manager capable of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initiating Communication**: It sends prompts or inputs to the AI model and manages the exchange of information.\n",
    "2. **Managing Execution**: It oversees the running of multiple recipes or an entire cookbook, allowing for batch processing and parallel testing.\n",
    "3. **Collecting Results**: It gathers the responses from the AI model, preparing them for analysis and review.\n",
    "4. **Executing Benchmark Runs**: Runners can execute benchmark runs where they run individual recipes or entire cookbooks, as demonstrated earlier in this notebook.\n",
    "5. **Conducting Red Team Sessions**: Runners can also be used to conduct red team sessions, which are designed to test the model's robustness against adversarial inputs. Examples of red team sessions will be shown later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark and Red Teaming with Runners\n",
    "\n",
    "Runners provide the flexibility to perform a variety of tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benchmark Runs**: You can use runners to execute recipes or cookbooks, which are sets of tests designed to evaluate the AI model's performance on specific tasks.\n",
    "- **Red Team Sessions**: For more adversarial testing, runners can manage red team sessions, challenging the AI model with scenarios intended to probe its weaknesses and assess its resilience."

    "While you've become familiar with creating and running recipes and cookbooks, the Moonshot framework offers a suite of additional API functions. These functions extend your capabilities beyond setup and execution, allowing for comprehensive management of endpoints, cookbooks, and red teaming activities. Here's how you can leverage these APIs to gain full control over your AI model evaluation workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deleting Endpoints**: Clean up your workspace by removing unused endpoints with the `api_delete_endpoint()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Cookbooks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating Cookbooks**: Keep your cookbooks current by adding new recipes or modifying existing ones using the `api_update_cookbook()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Useful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Listing Connectors and Templates**: Get an overview of all available connectors with `api_get_all_connector_type()` and manage prompt templates with corresponding functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieving Session Information**: For ongoing red teaming or benchmarking sessions, use `api_get_available_session_info()` to get session IDs and statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refreshing Recipes**: If you've made changes to recipes or added new ones, refresh the list of available recipes with `api_get_all_recipe()`.\n",
