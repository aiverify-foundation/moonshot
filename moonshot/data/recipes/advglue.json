    "description": "AdvGLUE is a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark that concentrates on assessing the adversarial robustness of language models. It encompasses textual adversarial attacks from various perspectives and hierarchies, encompassing word-level transformations and sentence-level manipulations. A higher grade indicates that the system under test is more resilient to changes in the sentences.",
