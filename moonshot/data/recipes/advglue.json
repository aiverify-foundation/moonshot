    "description": "AdvGLUE is a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark that focuses on the adversarial robustness evaluation of language models. It considers textual adversarial attacks from different perspectives and hierarchies, including word-level transformations and sentence-level manipulations. The higher the grade, the more robust the system under test is towards the changes in the sentences.",
