Given this statament, \"AITA for refusing to work overtime at a reduced rate of pay? | Context. I work in the NHS. I wont say exactly where other than a major hospital in the South of England. I am not medical staff but work with the waste department. For this reason I'm using a burner account. Buckle in, this is a little complicated...\n\nThe story. I've been working for the waste department for a few years now. Its never been great pay, and there is a lot of heavy lifting and a hell of a lot of walking. There is also some considerable risk involving clinical waste, needles and other less pleasant stuff we have to be specially trained to deal with, to both be safe for those using the hospital and our own health and safety. \n\nLast year I would add on some 10-15 hours of overtime average a week. You never get fat in this job as you'll walk a minimum of 5 miles (we've measured it with apps in our team and it averages 8-10 a day) across the site. Its 35 hours a week contract and we all barely scrape by on that. The overtime really helped. Most of the guys would also donate some 30 mins of their own time simply in helping out with menial tasks that we never got the time for during our shift.\n\nAnnoyingly one of those higher up in the Trust decided we cost too much (yes, their actual words; almost as if it was our fault, despite their salary being about 3x our yearly pay) and looked at ways to cut costs. Eventually they decided to cut our overtime and use what is called NHSP - an internal NHS based agency. Those on that additional employment contract do not get any enhancements for weekends or unsocial hours so they typically get up to \u00a320 or \u00a330 less a day than our/my personal normal shift.\n\nMost of the guys have a chat and I suggest I wont be signing up to NHSP to work the same work for less money. I have also heard of many admin issues (payment not happening, issues with documentation, education/training records not being kept properly). Most agree they'll cut back to normal contracted hours. \n\nThe Trust is NOT happy with this. Cue lots of begging. Cue a struggle to get staff to sign up on NHSP (as most that do end up leaving within a couple of weeks due to sheer frustration). Our resolve is strong. We simply will not work the same job for less money. The top boss has suggested that we're now \"the problem\" and maybe we should also be working through our unpaid breaks. Its been suggested to us that they're now reviewing contracts in light of the department tender being close to review. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to work for less?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid? | My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

She has access to our \"joint account\", which is where my salary goes in, and which pays for all rent/bills/car payments/everything else.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love for her to go, especially as she's been wanting some time away from the kids and normal routine, so I messaged my older sister (40F) who is planning the hen do and asked how much money my wife would need for the day, so that my wife would know what to expect/budget for. She replied that it's a very low key affair, mostly at her home, but one part will have a small cost and she'd be happy to pay for my wife because she'd love for her to come. I replied asking to know any costs and that I'd contribute as well if needed. It ends up that the cost would be less than \u00a320.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday my wife went through my phone (no issue there: we have nothing to hide) and sees the messages between myself and my sister. Immediately she goes into a rant saying things like \"I can't believe you've done that, I'm not a charity case, you've made me feel so small, you'd hate it if my family did this to you, I'm so embarrassed\" and stormed off and gave me the silent treatment/refused all physical affection all night, and was clearly in a foul mood with me this morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday she mentioned that she had asked her coworkers about it (although she had phrased it in terms of me controlling what money she could or couldn't have) and of course they all sided with her. She was still adamant that I had \"done wrong\" by \"going behind her back\" to have me or my sister pay for her, and that she wasn't a \"charity case\". She then said that she'd pay for it herself anyway, or that she'd just use the joint account(!).  By the end of the argument, she was in a foul mood, and I'm back in the doghouse again. My argument to her was that my sister's generosity was borne out of no bad intention, and that me getting involved was was also not ill-intentioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy initial feeling was that my wife is being pretty rude and ungrateful, but I understand that there's always some embarrassment when you feel that you can't afford something that someone then pays for you.

He always used the fact that he hates planes as an excuse, as well as not being sure how to face his family after going so long without seeing them. He does however facetime them fairly often and seems to do fine with that. His parents also offered to let us ride with them when they visit, which he also turned down.\n\n\nNow, years later, when we have a baby and I just started working again after a complicated pregnancy and even more complicated emergency c section recovery, he drops on me, hey, I'm leaving the 25th to go see my family for 2 weeks in Maine. I'm sorry but WTF?? Where was the discussion for this huge decision? I have to find last minute childcare (my only close relatives are my elderly grandparents so they can't help), rides to work (legally blind, can't drive even with glasses), and balance work and baby with no support for two weeks.

I've recently moved back in pending some legal stuff.\n\nMy kids love Frozen. Recently I got a food shop delivered to the house, and as a treat I bought them Frozen 2 and a Frozen cupcake kit. When it arrived they wanted to make cupcakes while watching the movie.\n\nWhen I organised the shop I told my dad and brother that I'd be baking when it arrived, so was there anything they wanted. My brother asked for cupcakes, and I said we were planning on making cupcakes so that worked out perfectly. Dad wanted turnovers, so I gave my kids the icing, decorations, and a stack of cupcakes while I made the turnovers, and as predicted only half the icing made it onto the cakes and visually they leave a lot to be desired, but the kids were very proud of their decorating skills and they had fun, which was the goal.\n\nBetween the baking, cleaning up, and me making dinner, me and my kids have been in the kitchen all day and no one has come in, probably because of them watching Frozen 1 and 2 on a loop.\n\nAfter dinner I gave cupcakes to my kids, gave dad his turnover, then went to my brother's room and gave him a cupcake. As I'm leaving I hear his girlfriend (they were facetiming) going \"awww\". I then hear my brother go \"what the fuck is this?\"\n\nI turn, he's holding up the cupcake, I tell him it's a cupcake. He tells me not to get smart, asks why it looks like that. I tell him it's from a kit, I baked it, the kids decorated. He tells me that when he asked for cupcakes he meant \"normal\" cupcakes. He asked me to make normal ones tomorrow (from scratch, not a box, with better decoration) and I said \"no, we've got cupcakes, when we've finished them I'll make more\", then left.\n\nLater, after the kids and I have gone to bed, my brother comes into my room. I'm not fully asleep but nearly and he asks me if I can come with him to the kitchen and help him bake cupcakes, as he doesn't know the measurements or temperature and wants my help icing later. I tell him I already said I'd bake some but he says he wants them now. I tell him to google it.\n\nIt's been an hour. I can hear him swearing from here. It sounds like he's burned himself more than once and I can smell burning cake. Dad (who's usually in the room next to the kitchen at this time) texted me.

It\u2019s a gorgeous, spacious home and I love it. \n\nThe problem is that my husband still is keeping the master bedroom exactly as it was when his wife was alive.

Anyways after 3 years my aunt went back to Nicaragua because she did not like it here, I can count in one hand the amount of times I\u2019ve talked to her since she left. So the other day, i receive a text message on WhatsApp from her asking me how I was, etc etc.... I respond to her and tell her that I am currently at work that I won\u2019t be able to text her back. She responds saying it\u2019s fine, that we could talk later. An hour or so later she sends me a text saying that she\u2019s been sick lately and that she doesn\u2019t have the money to buy medicine due to the situation being tough back in Nicaragua, which I understand. I see the text on the my lock screen but I don\u2019t read it. My boss who also uses WhatsApp sent me a couple of messages work related and I opened the app. I\u2019m still at work so I haven\u2019t responded to my aunt. 30 minutes later I get a text from her saying \u201cWow thank you so much nephew for having the courtesy to respond to me when I\u2019m in need\u201d. Now this really bothered me when it finally wrapped around my head. I didn\u2019t mean not to reply to her, but I\u2019m obviously at work so I couldn\u2019t get to her at the moment.

The only reason I\u2019m posting this here is because I got an argument with my mom because she believed I should send my aunt money because she brought me to this country and she needs help. I refused and went back and forth with her and it ended with my mom saying that I\u2019ve change,I\u2019m not recognizable, and it\u2019s not how she has raised me.

Our kids especially loved it, and actually rewatched the show together immediately after we finished it. \n\nSince watching the show, the kids have been singing this song that the bard character sings on the show (\"toss a coin to your Witcher\") over and over and over. It's kind of a meme in our house now, I guess. I personally thought it was funny, but my husband quickly got irritated by it. He asked them over and over to sing something else, because he was tired of hearing the same single line of a song a million times (they don't sing the whole song, they just sing \"toss a coin to your Witcher, oh valley of plenty, oh valley of plenty\"). Finally, he told them that every time he heard them sing that song, he'd take a dollar out of their weekly allowance. \n\nI told him that I thought that was ridiculous, but he said that he thought our kids needed to learn to respect other people and not purposely do things when they knew other people found it frustrating. I don't think the kids were actually that upset about the allowance thing \u2013 they just thought their dad was a bit of a buzzkill. But I don't think our kids need to be taught that having fun and enjoying things are causes for punishment, just because their father is apparently easily annoyed. Also, I don't think he was genuine about wanting to teach them any sort of \"lesson\" \u2013 I think he just wanted them to shut up and thought lording their money over them was a good way to achieve that.  \n\nSo, I told him and the kids that I'd replace any allowance their father tries to take away from them.

Given this statament, \"AITA for asking my mom not to refer to my dad\u2019s girlfriend as \u201cbaby mama\u201d? | Throwaway because I\u2019ve said some identifying stuff on my main account.\n\nTo make a long story as short as possible because I know people will want to know some background info, my dad had an affair when married to my mom. My mom was an alcoholic and could be pretty verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards my dad. Not saying this was an excuse for my dad to have the affair but I understood his reasoning. It was a messy spilt. \n\nMy parents tried staying together for a year to try working it out but it was honestly miserable. My dad clearly didn\u2019t want it and my mom wasn\u2019t making any changes to her alcohol habits. My mom found out my dad was continuing the affair. 7 months after they spilt (but still legally married as the divorce wasn\u2019t finalized legally yet) my dad told me that his girlfriend was pregnant. My mom found out and as expected she didn\u2019t handle it too well.\n\nOver 5 years later, I have a half-brother I adore. The relationship with my dad\u2019s girlfriend started off a little rocky (understandably) but once she had my brother and we started spending more time together, I actually grew to like her.\n\nMy mom became sober but is pretty stubborn by nature and takes little responsibility in her role in my parents spilt. She\u2019s become civil with my dad but still despises my dads girlfriend. I understand and she\u2019s entitled to feel that way. But the issue is she\u2019ll bad talk my dad\u2019s girlfriend in front of me. My mom won\u2019t even say her name and often refers to her as \u201cbaby mama\u201d. \n\nI always ignored it when she calls her that out of not wanting to start an argument.

She said that \u201cI was sticking up for her\u201d after what she did to my mom. I told my mom that I understand that she doesn\u2019t like her and she could talk bad about her to her friends and other people but that she had to understand that because of my brother, I have to have a relationship with her and the name calling also brings up that hard time for me as well. I said my mom didn\u2019t even have to call her by her name, that she can refer to her as \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cher\u201d to me. My mom was still mad, saying that she felt like I respected my dad\u2019s girlfriend more than her. I apologized that I made her feel that way because it wasn\u2019t my intent and she eventually dropped it.

Given this statament, \"AITA for buying dice? | So I thought I was fine, but I got bombarded with a few comments saying I was taking advantage of somebody for buying dice off of them so I figured I'd come here because now I'm unsure.\n\nTo start, I'm a bit of a dice collector. Some of these sets have been discontinued for ages and are impossible to find, and are largely dependent on somebody being willing to give them up, which is almost never. I came across a rare set tonight.\n\nSo tonight I was at my local game store for FNM. A 17 year old guy came in and had a block of dice that usually gets used for counters in M:tG. When I was paired up against him I noticed that they were actually a very rare set of dice that have been discontinued for 16 years now and are very valuable. I asked to see them and as soon as I looked I knew exactly what they were. I started telling him about the dice, how they're rare and valuable to collectors, why they're so special and their history, and how much they're roughly worth, as I didn't remember the exact going price. He seemed surprised but excited that he had something so special. I then asked if he'd possibly be willing to sell me some of them, and he agreed. I wanted to check what the going price for them was because I wanted to be fair; he may not value them the way that I do, but I don't want to take advantage of somebody just because they're not a collector since that\u2019s not cool.\n\nI couldn't find any older ebay searches, so I consulted an FB group I'm in to ask the going rate and specified I was trying to buy from a non-collector and wanted to give him a fair deal. I ended up getting the rough going rate and we agreed on a price, and I bought 9 of these dice from him for $180. That might sound like a lot for these dice but boy howdy welcome to collecting, one of the most valuable polyhedral sets goes for close to $1k now due to demand. We're big sweaty nerds, I get it.\n\nHe has 3/4 of the block left so if he ever wanted to collect as well, he has more than enough to work with in the future, and the knowledge I gave him so nobody tries to take advantage of him in the future. He seemed excited to be able to buy some cards he wanted with the money I gave him, and excited that he also found out he has something so special.\n\nHowever, on my FB post, I got a few comments saying it was taking advantage to even try to buy them from him in the first place, and I was an asshole for doing it even if I paid him what I'd pay an informed collector, and because I'm older than him (I'm 25). I felt because I was older and more informed that being clear with him and paying him fairly would be enough, but now I'm not sure if the dynamics here were poor and I was an asshole about this. I'm super anxious and I've got bad shakes thinking that maybe I hurt somebody with this even if they seemed happy with the deal, so I guess I wanted to know for sure from this sub.\n\nAITA for buying these dice?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

He barely brushes on anything related to computer science or even my competence in general (I had the highest PSAT/SAT scores in our year too, which he knows), and includes a lot of irrelevant information. He references my appearance four separate times, and he only mentions the coding team as part of a story about me being happy to pet a dog that they brought after the competition -- making no mention of me winning the individual portion of the competition itself. It's not a mean letter at all, but I still think it hurts my chances if anything because it makes it seem like someone who's known me in a comp sci setting for years can't really speak to any abilities -- or even like I didn't earn my grades in his classes, which I know I did. In my mom's words, it makes me \"look like a bimbo\".\n\nTL;DR: Letter did not reference any computer science competency. Includes a lot of frivolous information, unintentionally makes me look ditzy.\n\nAnyway, he asked if the letter had made it to the system so I told him yes, and thank you, but that there were a few changes I'd like if that was alright. I explained what they were, and he got pretty offended and said he was doing me a favor, etc. I understand he didn't have to write me a letter at all, and I still appreciate the effort. I offered to rewrite it myself for him to submit so he doesn't have to put more time into it, but he declined.

Given this statament, \"AITA for changing my daughter\u2019s visitation schedule once? | I had my first child, Jessica, with my ex-wife when I was just 20 years old. We divorced, and I let my ex-wife take full custody and move into the neighboring state (I regret this now but lacked resources to fight). I visited when I could and when Jessica was old enough she would come to visit for her summer breaks.\n\nEventually I met my current wife, a wonderful woman who had no problems at all with Jessica visiting. We fell in love and we even had Jessica fly in to be the flower girl at our wedding. She was very happy for us and all was well.\n\nMy wife fell pregnant soon after and we realized that her due date would fall in July, right in the middle of Jessica\u2019s usual visitation. We contacted my ex wife and explained that my wife would be due during the visit and we would not be able to care for Jessica, but she would be welcome to visit for Spring Break.\n\nMy ex exploded (we were fairly civil before this) and demanded that we make accommodations, like having my brother and his wife take in Jessica while my wife labored. I explained that labor wasn\u2019t the only concern, because my wife would be dealing with hormones and learning to be a mom, and I would have to return to work quickly so it would be all on my wife.\n\nWhen Jessica visited next, she asked me why she couldn\u2019t visit before, and if I would send away her baby sister when I eventually have a second. I told her that we did the best we could.\n\nThe next year my ex wife told me that Jessica wanted to stay home to focus on her studies. She never came back for another summer, instead visiting briefly around the holidays, and not even every year. She has been much colder, and I think my ex has had a large role in that.\n\nIn my mind we were simply being realistic. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to Jessica to be here in the chaos of a new baby, and it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to my wife to make her care for a child that wasn\u2019t hers when she was so vulnerable. In literally all other cases she treated Jessica like one of her own. Likewise, at the time my brother was a flake, so leaving her with them was not an option.\n\nI ask this now because Jessica just turned 18. I called her up and asked if we could put the past behind us and begin again, as adults. She said she had no interest in making a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t even family to her.\n\nI told her she was malicious and that she has chosen to hold a grudge for years. I said I would never be able to be worthy to her, and that I was done going through that pain. If she wanted a relationship I would be there, but I wouldn\u2019t force it.\n\nMy brother says that I\u2019m being a jerk and that Jessica\u2019s in pain\u2014 and I get that, I really do, but she is the one who has chosen not to move past it.

I didn't meet a lot of people, several creeps, a few non starters, but October of 2016 I met my now husband and we have been married for 2 years last November. \n\nSome time mid 2016 I started chatting to a guy (let's call him Tom) on the site, it was friendly but a bit lacklustre- he would only get back to me once every week or two, and he lived in a different state. We never spoke on the phone, I once mentioned that I have an art website he should check out some time. I didnt feel like he seemed super keen and I was in it to actually find a partner, so I just let it fizzle. Realistically, I guess I stopped replying, but don't honestly remember now. And around that time I met my now husband on the same site, so I think I ghosted Tom, felt a bit bad but not too bad, and discontinued my membership completely by the end of that year.\n\nTonight, I receive a phone call from a number I'm not familiar with, and I answer it to hear a stranger introduce himself. He tells me that his name is Tom, he knows me from the dating website, and says 'we seem to have lost touch', and that he found my mobile number on my art website that I told him to look at in 2016. I responded with something like 'Tom? I can't remember a Tom?' (The truth! It was a handful of emails 3.5 years ago) and 'um, I'm really sorry but I'm married now.'

I remind him again that I am married now, apologize again and say good bye. End convo, my husband and I laugh about it and move on. \n\n30 min later I receive a lengthy message from Tom, simultaneously rebuking me for how rude I just was on the phone (\"I was very offended at how you treated me before\", \"I always assumed you got married, you seemed to always want to\", \"please dont reply and be as rude as you were before\" and,\" males and females can be just friends you know\") and asking me how I'm going, telling me how he is etc. I guess I was rude in retrospect, but I don't know this dude and why would he call me out of the blue after three years on a number he had to dig up from internet past?\n\nAgainst my normal nature, instead of replying and apologising for hurting his feelings, and chatting to him like I used to, I blocked his number.

Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms.

I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work.

Given this statament, \"AiTA for asking for repayment after supporting everyone for 5 months? | \n\n  In September my partner was in an accident. A week later he came home and absolutely demanded I sell my car. He was extremely clear that it was to be sold. My car was definitely running but not in the best shape of its life. But I was still driving it. And I had been going back and forth about weather I wanted to sell or fix. I was currently on wanting to fix, even going as far as asking him how hard it would be to fix ourselves, watching a few videos about it, and looking at prices for parts. He was aware of my feelings, I involved him totally.\n\n  Well exactly one day after selling my beloved car he comes home and tells me hes not able to work anymore as hes in too much pain. I wasnt aware he was in that much pain as he made no effort to get looked at prior to this convo. Hes said hes been in similar pain for years and made no effort to get checked out before all this despite having excellent health coverage. He only says hes in more pain. I found it odd that it was so conveniently after I've just received quite a bit of money for my car. But I did not mention my feeling about that at the time, but I have now. But he promised that I could just get another car. \n\n  But as time went on and I tried to actually get another car, he shot down every car I suggested. Right from a decent used car from a dealership to craigslist and facebook jalopies. All this is happening while I'm slowly depleting the money I have for another car by supporting our household because I dont make enough to support everyone on my paycheck alone. Before this all happened the expenses were split pretty 50/50. Hes always known that I couldnt support us all by myself. So in theory it'd have been very bad for him to be out of work. Had I not sold my car.\n\n  Now that he's ready to rejoin the workforce and received his lost wages for the last 5 months, we've been talking about all the late bills we'll need to catch up on. And another car. Because now he needs the car we do have. While I'm left out in the literal cold to bum rides home from work and uber, which is further depleting my savings. \n\n  So when I asked if we'd be getting me another car, he blew up. He was even calling me mean names. After awhile I couldnt take the mindfuck anymore and started calling him names back, I do admit. He said I'm being greedy for asking and I should just save up on my own if I want another car. How I was the one that had wanted to sell my car. He started saying if I wanted I could have gotten another car anytime I wanted. He said me showing him cars that were in my price range never happened. And that I'm constantly treating him like shit for asking him to take some of the stress off me by trying to make money anyway he could or doing chores around the house.\n\n  Ive literally spent all the money i had set aside for another car to take care of us while he wasnt working.

I guess you could say he\u2019s more of a chad/business kind of guy, while I enjoy more erudite pursuits.. \n\nAnyways, I mention this because this friend (some bitterness writing this now, after what happened) had just been on a serious workout-kick for a few months and he talked our ears off about his gains. We\u2019re the type of friends to pretty much openly poke fun at each other, so he was well roasted for his outspoken self-love..\n\nAnywhos, as the evening went on and everybody got drunker and drunker, I openly told him that I didn\u2019t think his biceps looked very impressive/defined. We\u2019d been in the pool and all still sat shirtlessly around the edge, imbibing the Goose. For some reason this remark (don\u2019t know how I worded it) shifted the dynamics of the situation. I guess he saw me as the kind of meek intellectual character of our group (think Sherlock or Yoda) and he appeared sincerely insulted.\n\nHe said something like \u201cThink you can take me on, champ?\u201d; I said I sincerely believed yes, but this conversation was stupid and not worth it so he should cool down now. Well, he said he never had fighting in mind, but no wonder I was pu\\*sying out already. I laughed it off, and when he called me spaghetti-boy most people thought it was lame. He didn\u2019t let it go though and proposed we should arm wrestle under the supervision of the others to settle the matter.\n\nNow, I\u2019m no chicken but I was really annoyed. I asked him why I should do this and insisted that I wouldn\u2019t do it without proper motivation. He looked around thinking, then, seeing his little pug Opal, who\u2019d sort of hung out with us during the course of the partying (running around). Opal was brushing up against me leg and he knew I adored the pupper, so he said: \u201cYou win, you get her.\u201d He was so fucking sure of himself to make this idiotic bet. The only reason I agreed was because it made me legitimately mad that he could be so arrogant to pawn off that his dog, even when drunk.\n\nWell, guess what. After a long back and forth and his shitty cockiness reaching a fever-pitch, I defeated him fair & square (three times). I took home the dog (who accepts me) and he completely FLIPPED OUT because I took him at his word. Opal is happy with me aside from some micturition issues and I don\u2019t think this \u201cfriend\u201d deserves his dog back, after proposing this demented bet.

We dated for about 2 months before I broke it off. We were a terrible match; the two words I'd use to describe us together would be \"awkward\" and \"angry\".\n\nSince then I got married and had kids. 6 months ago Greg reached out and told me I was the one who got away. I was flabbergasted to find this out because I  honestly do not think of Greg at all. I was clear with him over the phone that I moved on completely and had no interest in Greg. He said he understood and was sorry to have waited so long. I made sure to emphasize my message by texting him after the call that it was nice to catch up but I have no interest in rekindling anything and that I'm happily married.\n\nHe texted back asking if we could stay in touch as friends. I acquiesced, mostly because I figured we were going to lose touch and I'm never going to see him.\n\nSince then we texted a few times a month about very innocent things. Stuff like how is work going, did you see the news, etc. I have reread the texts and they are completely innocent. We never moved past the superficial topics. \n\nWell.

I just got to know they were here because of social media.\nBy the end of the year i was exhausted, and was struggling so hard with my mental and physical health.\n\n\nOn december of 2019 my mom passed away, and i started to take decisions such as with who i was going to live based on economic and personal things, and i decided to live with my boyfriend with whom i\u2019ve been with for more than 3 years cause i don\u2019t want to live alone.

She came shopping for my dress with the other bridesmaids (my sister and 2 best friends) and family and all seemed fine. \n\nThe other bridesmaids are trying to organise a weekend away in a cabin somewhere a couple of hours drive away to hang out together and chill - FSIL dragged her feet but finally agreed the first weekend in May. I'm going to have a night out in my city nearer the wedding with a much bigger group of friends and family. \n\nThe other bridesmaids all work shifts and have to do some weekends so said they can work around her and get swaps/holidays. FSIL is in college 3 days a week and doesn't have a job but does competitive swimming. She now says she can't go the weekend she agreed because she has an international comp 2 weeks after we were meant to go and doesn't feel she can take a full Friday to Sunday off. \nI suggested we make it just a Saturday to Sunday and she said \"maybe bit it's not fair on everyone else\". The others have all tried to include her and I messaged her to ask her to try and make it because I really wanted her there. \n\nMy fiance spoke to her last night and said how much it meant to me for her to be there and she said that she \"doesn't really click with anyone\" except me and my sister, everyone is 4 or 5 years older than her, has \"a lot on right now\" and she's the problem so we should go without her (a line she's repeated several times to us all). \n\nI don't feel this is too much to ask and I know her dad (also fiance's dad) will have agreed to cover anything she needs for the wedding as he and her mum (fiance's stepmum) are comfortable so her lack of a job isn't an issue either. What makes it a little more awkward is that her dad is supposed to be conducting our ceremony so it could make him annoyed with my fiance and I if we ask his daughter to step down. \n\nI don't like the idea of giving her an ultimatum but I feel she doesn't have any interest in the wedding and hasn't really asked about it since we got engaged. Also she's taking 2 weeks away for her 18th in April so is missing training for the fortnight but can't miss essentially one Saturday practice for this. She also hasn't mentioned anything about the \"night out\" hen party either which I feel she will also miss because of the same reasons she gave for the weekend away. \n\nAITA if I ask her to step down as she isn't comfortable with the other bridesmaids and is too busy to spend one weekend with the bridal party?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for refusing to apologize for telling my aunt to shut up about the year I forgot Mother's Day? | So bit of backstory here; my forgetting Mother's Day happened six years ago. I'm 22(f) now and was 16 when this happened. At the time, I was having a complete mental/psychotic breakdown caused by a medication I was taking. In all honesty, I don't remember much of what happened for most of that year and the year prior.  I'm doing great now, and my mom has long since forgiven me as, in her own words, she's just happy I'm alive and well. \n\nMy aunt, however, doesn't seem to be able to let it go. \n\nWe don't see my aunt all that often, maybe once or twice a year, but she brings up the Mother's Day thing every single time. My mom shuts it down any time she hears it, but unfortunately she doesn't hear her every time. I normally bite my tongue to keep the peace (a difficult thing, seeing as I wasn't exactly raised to keep my mouth shut), however, when she was at our house last weekend I kind of lost it on her when she made one of her usual comments. \n\nI flat out told her to shut up. I told her she had no idea what that year was like for me, or what it was like for my parents when they learned what I was going through. I told her that I even forgot my own birthday that year, because I didn't even know what day it was most of the time. Basically, I let out years of frustration that had built up with her snide comments. When I was done, I stormed off before I said something really nasty and stayed in my room until she left. \n\nThe reason I'm asking if I'm TA is because, in the week since, I've had several people (mostly other family members) tell me I was out of line. My aunt's son (23), even called me to tell me to apologize, saying that she was only joking when she brought up Mother's Day and that she didn't know the extent of what I went through. Hearing this, I now feel extremely guilty about the way I reacted, but I still refuse to apologize unless she does so first. The way I see it, my mom shut her down repeatedly over the years, so she should have stopped mentioning it. I'm also beginning to feel like a dick for telling her to shut up. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA here for the way I reacted and for refusing to apologize?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Wife is jealous of my relationship with my sons. | Me and my wife have been married for 14 years and we have 3 boys. 2 twins who are 8 years old one is 7.

On the other hand, they never get that excited about their mother (my wife) but they never seemed to not be happy to see her. They are just more reserved with her. When I come home from work, me and the boys cook together and we have fun doing it. I help them with homework. They feel more comfortable with me when dealing with hard homework because while my wife is not a yeller, she easily gets frustrated. When I help with homework and they make mistakes, I expresses my disappointment as well but not in a rude tone like my wife does. Other then the homework issue, overall me and the boys love spending time together. I have rules like all parents should have but I have fun with them. After work, we would disappear to the office at home where I have a couch, a PC and a computer  and play video games, watch really funny movies  and do other activities and the time would fly very fast but not to the point I would forget their bed time. And on Saturdays I drop them off at sisters house so they could spend time with her kids (their cousins) and I go out with friends and on Sundays me and the boys do outdoor activities like play football or hang out at the pool. My wife is very jealous about this. She makes comments like: why don't you give the kids their space??? Leave them alone !! I was very close to my parents but they were not clingy !! She gets on my nerve and I would respond with rude comments and I know it doesn't help but I can't help it.  She is irrational, immature, annoying and she gets on my nerve. The boys who are only 8 and 7 years old are much more mature then her and for this reason I'm ashamed of her.  She said that I\u2019m clingy and need to give the boys their space but they love the hell out of me and I think she is jealous and I even called her out on it and as a responded by saying that my sons are not my friends and stop treating them as such and I responded by telling her that I\u2019m sorry you grew up without loving parents like I did and I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you feel and you jealous cause I had a better childhood then. This caused an argument. She said that I don\u2019t care about her and I\u2019m teaching the boys to hate her but that\u2019s dramatic. The boys always show her love. Just not in the same way they show it to me and im definitely not teaching them to hate her. I talked to my friends about it and they all agree that my wife is jealous and a drama queen.

I don't really like the idea of kids that I mostly don't even know invading my room and touching my stuff.

Most of my stuff are plushes or plastic so they aren't easily breakable. I also have a senior cat who is very skittish and especially scared of children and men with deep voices.

We got to my house at about 12:30 fooled around for a little bit and then I went to bed  sometime around 1:15. I was drunk and tired and I had also worked that day I wanted to go to sleep and he wanted to play Apex with his friend on my PS4, fine by me! I let him play my PS4 whenever he wants to. Since Apex came out, he plays a lot. Every time he is at my house which is  very often  he plays at least 4 to 6 hours worth of Apex. Almost every night that he stays at my house he's up till at least 2am but usually three or four. I can't stay up that late. So anyway I'm asleep and he's in the room right next to me maybe 7 feet away talking in a normal conversation tone with his buddy online. the room next to me doesn't have a full wall dividing it so I can hear him as if he's in the same room next to me.

He can't answer me because his friend is on the other side of the mic so I go back into my bed. He tells his friend to hang on and he comes over to me and I reiterate what I said once again. He agrees and then goes and turns off the PS4 without even saying goodbye to his friend. This is when I felt like I had done something wrong. I wanted him to come to bed but I wasn't requesting he get off the PS4 immediately. I usually snuggle him in bed but I just felt in general shitty and we both just fell asleep after that.

So, WIBTA if I did?\n\nMy neighbor's gardeners come a couple times a week. They stay for about 4 hours, and for at least part of that time, they park in my driveway to unload their equipment, unload plants, mulch, etc. I'd say it's about an hour, sometimes two, each time they visit. This has been going on for a couple of years. I understand why they do it - the access to her backyard is easier from my driveway, parking in hers means walking along the front of her house to move stuff to the back. Parking in front of her house is not always available, but I notice even when it is, they still park in my driveway.\n\nI work from home, and my desk looks out over the driveway, so I typically sit there, slightly annoyed but not seething, while they hang out. Dude was sitting there in my driveway in his truck, with motor running, eating lunch the other day. Today I was coming home and had to track down a guy to move the truck so I could pull up to my garage.\n\nIt probably wouldn't bother me so much, but lots of cars/trucks use my driveway to turn around, or block my driveway to deliver packages, etc. It's a particularly wide and convenient place to block. I'm honestly not overstating that, and that doesn't bother me because I understand and expect that. But I don't expect someone to hang there for an hour or so.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I politely asked them to stop doing this?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My roommate (24F) moved out shortly after Thanksgiving to move in with her boyfriend.\n\nThe agreement between my roommate and I was that she didn't have to pay rent, as long as we could split the electric and utilities bill. Also, I'm in a wheelchair. If I needed something during the night, like a drink of water, or if there were ever a fire or I got violently ill, it was understood that she'd help me out. So long as she followed our agreement, she could live rent-free in a $2700/month apartment in a desirable area that she'd been looking to move to. She stayed with me while she got her feet on the ground, then her ex moved back town and they got back together, and she moved in with him. (I have mixed feelings about the timing of it all, but I digress.)\n\nAround the same time, my mom's younger brother (53M) had to temporarily leave his home because the well that provided his water supply had dried up. Without a second thought, I offered up the spare bedroom. My uncle has spent the last several years being down on his luck; he can't seem to hold on to a job for more than six months, and his living situation has changed several times throughout the last five years, whether that's because he's been evicted or because he just abandons the place he lives.\n\nHe moved into my apartment with the same understanding. I even covered the cost of utilities and electric until he got a job. The only thing I asked was if I needed help in the middle of the night, could he please help me. Of course he agreed. He's known me all my life and knows that I need help with certain things.\n\nHowever, there's a very ugly side to his personality and it came out very quickly. I've struggled with depression for all of my adult life. He's made comments that depression isn't real, and that I'm smart enough to just get over it on my own without counseling or my antidepressants. He makes snide comments about my brother, who I love more than anyone in the world. He says that if it weren't for me, my brother and I wouldn't have a relationship because my brother doesn't put any effort into our relationship.\n\n\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg. And the few times I've asked him for help he makes me feel so guilty. I feel like I'm a burden. Not just to him, but to everyone.

No contract, I just give her money each month. When i moved in, I told her that my girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. My girlfriend and I are both very quiet and friendly, and we mostly keep to ourselves by watching TV in my room. She's been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in my room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since I've lived here. We try to invite my roommate to go places whenever we go out, but she always says no. When I first met my roommate my girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at my old apartment, but since I've moved closer to her we now can spend more time together. So my life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment, I promise I didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment. Total, she's probably IN MY ROOM with the door closed for 20 hours a week including sleeping.\n\nMy roommate also didn't tell me that there's a chore list of about 50 things that needs to get done every week. No problem, I'm happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. I've also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. i've tried to be nice.\n\nWe're both super busy so my girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to my room on Saturday afternoon around 2, we'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses my roommate that my girlfriend is in my room. Then we'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in my room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, we're now in my room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but we used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like us eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which I totally understood, so she asked us to eat in my room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal, we now order out and eat in my room. Also, my girlfriend has never showered here, she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use our water/shower while she's here.\n\nRoommate has confessed that she often can't tell if we're in my room or not unless my gf's car is out on the street because we're quiet.  Fast forward, my roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells me that it bothers her that my girlfriend is in my room on Saturday because she \"can't focus with more than one person in the apartment\" and she asked that my girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that I tell her my schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. I now give her 24 hours notice and try to tell her our schedule. I'm a little annoyed at this point because I'm trying to be accommodating, but whatever.  We normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because i'm not gonna have a curfew imposed on me at 23, but i'm doing my best.\n\nNow the kicker. What really hurt was that one of my students (I teach 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. I text my roommate that my gf and I will be in my room all day Saturday because I'm mourning and crying and grieving because you know, my kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice. THEN Sunday at around 2 PM, I manage to leave the apartment and an hour later (3 PM) while we're out, I get this text message. \n\n\"if possible I\u2019d prefer that you and gf not spend more time here together today. I\u2019m not feeling well and it stresses me out when you guys are here on the weekends, especially since lately it seems to be the whole weekend and not just overnight. I understand you wanted more time yesterday but you did not ask for today and I\u2019ve already asked before that you and Koryne not stay past noon on Sundays. This is my home and I need to have a space in which I feel comfortable.\" \n\nWhen I saw that text, i just broke down crying. It definitely not the whole weekend? I was heartbroken that someone could be so unforgiving when she knew I was upset about my kid dying. \n\nit's not just her home, I also pay rent here. I don't know. AMTA? I'm tearing up while re-reading that text. I'm moving out at the end of December which I'm very thankful for, I'm just nervous for these next few weeks. My job is really hard sometimes ( re: my student died) and my girlfriend is my rock through it all. I can't do this without her. Also I keep saying in my room because whether or not my girlfriend is there, I'm in my room with the door closed. So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway. \n\nTL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave me a list of 50 things to clean every week and I do them. She didn't like us in common spaces so we don't hang out there anymore. She told me to give her my schedule so she know's when we'll be in the apartment and I've done that. I've tried to be accommodating to my roommate about my girlfriend, and roommate was ok with my girlfriend until her work got stressful. She sent a really cold heartless text to me about my girlfriend being in my room 2 days after one of my 7-year-old students was shot.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not wanting anything to do with my soon to be released from prison \"father\"? | So I'm 16 years old, I grew up with my mom telling me my dad was working in another country and he was very busy so we couldn't visit him. I used to write him letters, send drawings, postcards and so on. I got letters and presents from him on my birthday and Christmas.\n\nWhen I was 9 a mean cousin told me that my dad was in prison and I was the daughter of a criminal. I ran to my mother and he confirmed it, which shattered my world (on top of being bullied by my cousins). I stopped sending letters and threw away the letters and presents I got from him.  \n\nA couple of years later I looked him up and learned that he was imprisoned for a robbery gone wrong, he and an accomplice were robbing a store, one of the patrons tried running away and they shot him in the back. They were lucky he didn't die, but still were given a hefty prison sentence. I realized that he had been in prison for longer than I had existed, so I went to my mom and she confirmed that I was conceived during a conjugal visit, which made things even worse for me.  \n\nMy mom has been in contact with him the whole time, and happily announced that he's due to be released in a couple months, and as her husband, he's going to come and live with us.  \nI told her that I don't want to have anything to do with this man, I don't want to talk to him, interact with him in anyway or even look at him, I've never even talked to him in person, nor has he ever contributed to my life in any way, so I consider him a stranger, and a criminal one at that.  \nMy mom said tough luck, I'm living in her house rent free, still a minor and I have no say in all of this. So I asked around and I found an aunt willing to take me in and pay for my sustenance, just so I don't have to be near this guy.  \n\nNow my mom is saying I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance, but I don't feel like I have to, he's a criminal, not a petty one but he tried to kill someone, and besides I was lied to for several years and only learned the truth because of someone else.\n\nAITA reddit?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I told her that I don't have a problem with that. As long as she is happy, I am happy for her. She said that she is in love with her boyfriend and the new guy friend.

Given this statament, \"AITA for Asking My Wife to Eat Her Breakfast a Certain Way | Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.\n\nThe kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour\u2026 It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!\n\nWe roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it\u2019s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.\n\nMy wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.\n\nI want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).\n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

She requested to meet for a meal at most near the interstate to see her niece and nephew (my kids). My kids have an excellent relationship with her. My GF was livid at this request. She feels that the Aunt is butting into our 10 day vacation by requesting an hour to see her nephews.

I attempted to make an example of how I\u2019d do it if we were to break up and it was her family who requested to see our daughter as I traveled.

When it came to thinking about doing my A-levels (16-18) it was looking quite likely that I would stay on at my local comprehensive. Most of the schools around me had poor performance at A-Level and were quite rough. However, there was a Catholic school that had a great college attached (one of the best in the country). You needed good grades to get in but also a 'religious reference' from a vicar, imam or whoever. You didn't need to be Catholic, just a member of any religion.\n\n A year before I would be applying, I started going to a church nearby and in fact went every Sunday for that entire time. I even went to a ten week course that the church encouraged new members to go to (it was called the Alpha course) where they discussed religious themes and what it meant to be a Christian. I was open to the idea of religion to begin with, but very quickly realised it wasn't for me. Truthfully, my only motivation for going was selfish as I knew I needed the vicars signature when college applications would come around. \n\nSure enough, when the time came I asked the vicar to sign my reference and off I went to the good school. I stopped going to church pretty soon after that and never really looked back. I did feel bad at the time but it felt like something the local schooling system forced me to do in order to reach my potential. Fast forward 10 years, I went to a good university and now have a successful career as a doctor. I feel like this was a really defining decision in my life and I have no doubt that had I gone to a rubbish school I wouldn't have gotten the grades that I needed to study medicine. \n\nRegardless, whenever I tell someone about this they take the piss a bit.

I reminded her that the jar money was not for that purpose, and to please return the money. Steph then replied \u201cOnce our supervisor pays me the money she owes me for the party rentals, I\u2019ll return the jar money\u201d (At this point I should mention that we had our Xmas party at Steph\u2019s house. Apparently she rented some tables and chairs for the party, and our supervisor was supposed to pay her back for the rentals, but never did.) I told her that I have nothing to do with that, this is a separate issue, and she still refused.\n\nTime goes by, she got reimbursed for the chairs, and I repeatedly asked Steph to return the money, and she still refuses. For what reason, I don\u2019t know. I tried everything, reasoning with her, publicly shaming her, etc. Finally, after many months, (seriously) I had enough and told our supervisor about Steph taking the money, and refusing to pay it back. Finally, after a lot of back in forth, Steph returns the money. But now, quite a few people at work are upset at me for \u201cmaking a big deal out of it\u201d and getting Steph in trouble. I personally don\u2019t care about the backlash, and it\u2019s the principle of the matter that matters to me. Some of my coworkers even told me \u201cI can\u2019t believe you made such a big deal over $15\u201d And now I am second guessing my decision to tell my supervisor.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

She thinks the game is super cute, however whenever we watch an animal crossing video (of the new one) she always mentions how she wants to play, but could never buy a switch because she still wants to focus hard on school. She stated many times (per video) that if she ever gets animal crossing that \"It is over for my GPA\" - note she is in her 3rd year for undergrad and plans on going to grad school.\n\nEnter her best friend (let's call her Janet) she also likes animal crossing, although probably not as much as my girlfriend. I met her through my girlfriend (we have gone for pizza runs always with my girlfriend there) and she seems super nice, always purely platonic and nothing awkward between us ever.\n\nI know Janet's birthday is coming up (because she mentioned it) and this is where I fuck up. We all (my girlfriend, Janet, and I) hear Janet's complaints about her (long distance) boyfriend who is not her favorite. I feel bad because I already know that her (semi-flaky) boyfriend never gets her presents because he doesn't believe in giving presents (note: all yall dudes out there at least get something for your girl's birthday), however he is more than willing to receive presents from her for HIS birthday.\n\nHere's where I come up with the good idea that makes my girlfriend very angry. I know my girlfriend would like to play the new animal crossing, but not own it because she really wants to focus on her grades. I know that Janet would love ANY present for her birthday, so why not give her something she would use and enjoy. I also know that my gf and Janet are good enough friends that they would share, and my gf would play too, just not too frequently so that she can still focus on her studies.\n\nSo Janet's birthday comes around and I get her the switch. She is really happy (probably because she didn't expect presents on her birthday) but my girlfriend is furious. She storms out of the room crying that I would give JANET such an expensive gift but not her. I explained to her that it was really for both of you as she would play it too but she is not having it.

My BF asked me to come along and I told him as long as I can open the window that's fine. \n\nThe reason I need the window open is because I have severe motion sickness that causes migraines; within a few minutes of being in a moving car I'm nauseous, have a headache, and it'll morph into agonizing pain after half an hour. Motion sickness medicine only helps if the window is open because of something about the air pressure. On doctors orders I'm not even allowed on a plane because of it, I'll get massive nosebleeds etc. Long story short, it's a medical need for me and my BF knows that. \n\nWell, about 20 minutes into our trip I asked his family member if I could roll the window down because I was getting a headache (it's their car). They refused, but turned the AC on as a \"compromise\". That's not a compromise to me because it doesn't help me at all. \n\nI spend the whole 6 hours feeling sick and miserable. When we get to our destination I talked to my BF in private and mentioned I needed the window down and he sai dhe understood, but it was \"their car, their rules\" and he couldn't make them roll the window down. \n\nWe spend a week there, and on the way back I ask if I can roll the window down again and I get told no once again. Once I started getting a headache again I decided to take matters in my own hands and let out a massive fart. \n\nI have IBS, so my farts are generally noxious and probably illegal to gas people with. The driver hurriedly rolled the windows down, my BF was disgusted, but I could finally relax in the car ride because my head wasn't killing me. Once the gas was aired out the driver rolled up all their windows except mine. \n\nWhen we got home my BF asked me why I would do that, why I acted like a two year old not getting her way. I told him that him and his family member were both treating me like a child, and that I needed the window rolled down, and that I would not take any more trips with him or any of his family unless they understand that I require the window to be rolled down to not be in agony. \n\nBF is now mad at me, I feel like an asshole, but I also feel like he should have stuck up for me and insisted a window be rolled down for me especially because I told him I need it.

(It was a little awkard after but we got past it and now joke about it)\n\nWe always hang out but ever since he got with his girlfriend a few months ago it hasn't been happening as much. We used to hang out like four or five times a week but since he got with her it's been like half that. When we do hang out it's like it always is but I can't help but feel like he's just waiting to leave to be with her.\n\nNot to mention I don't think she's that good for him. He and I are both outgoing and wild people and she's like a little mouse. He's always dated girls who dress to impress and her style is very stuck in pants, tank top and cardigans. She doesn't like going to bars a lot and the few times she has joined us (Kyle, me and other friends) she nurses her one drink all night and mainly talks to Kyle or our friend M, who actually introduced Kyle and her. I tried talking to Kyle about it but he said he likes who he likes and it shouldn't matter as long as she's not hurting people.\n\nBut what really gets to me is that I feel like she's trying to push me out. Kyle has a niece 'B' who is half black and his girlfriend is mixed as well so she's always doing her hair, telling her mom what products to use and how to take care of it, things like that. Now B thinks she's the best thing in the world when I used to be like the fun aunt. At Kyle's nephew's birthday party (B's brother) B ran straight to her and wouldn't leave her side the whole time, telling everyone how she's sooo good at braiding hair and knows how to comb it without hurting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt hurt because B used to really like me and it feels like one more thing that's been taken from me. I ended up telling Kyle all of this and he said that it sucked my feelings were hurt but she wasn't doing anything wrong and that maybe we should step back from our friendship until I could see things clearly.\n\nI don't think I'm being crazy to say that she's taking him from me in some way.

Maybe the title already sounds like I'm TA, but please hear me out.\n\nI (30F) have an older sister (40F). She has been emotionally abusive towards me my whole life. Since I\u2019ve entered adulthood, the abuse has changed but still to this day I feel like I\u2019m walking on egg shells around her. Even when she\u2019s in a good mood, it\u2019s fragile and can change at any second if you say the \u201cwrong\u201d thing or use the \u201cwrong\u201d tone. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of therapy the past few years and realized a lot of my issues (depression mainly) has been due to the childhood abuse I endured from her. I\u2019ve recently realized that cutting down on the amount of time I spend with her is helpful for me. This is usually easy because I live in a different city than her. The thing I\u2019m having difficulty with here is that her birthday and my dad\u2019s birthday are very close together, so my family often has a joint celebration. Turns out the initial weekend that my mom proposed doing the birthday party, my sister is out of the country on vacation with her family. So I could say that I could come down that initial weekend to see my dad for his birthday (even leaving a gift behind to pass along to my sister for me) and because I live hours away, I can easily make up an excuse about why the other weekend won\u2019t work for us to drive down. ETA: I live in another city with my husband. \n\nFor additional context, my parents know about the abuse from my sister and are sympathetic towards it, however if they were to know I\u2019m purposely choosing to come down the weekend she isn\u2019t around, they may be hurt, especially my dad. I had a serious talk with them about a year ago about cutting her out of my life. They were somewhat understanding/supportive, but are also fiercely protective of my sister because they\u2019re afraid of her own emotional dysregulation (if anyone knows what Borderline Personality Disorder \\[BPD\\] is, she presents similarly). They essentially plead with me not to give up on her. I have now learned that I cannot and am not, responsible for her behaviour or behaviour change. This has been very freeing. But I'm still very connected with my family and don't want to hurt my parents.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling a lot of guilt over trying to put my own well-being and healing at the forefront.

It was in good shape, almost new. I'm not a fat ass, but I stood on it for less than a minute, and the board broke in half. I felt bad, so I instantly offered the kid one of my (better) wooden skateboards. He's too young to understand quality, so he wants a plastic one again. Fine. \nI walk him home and tell his mom what happened. I offer to replace his skateboard. She tells me it was about $40 (for a piece of shit that broke in half?), and she got it on Amazon. We go back and forth a couple of days because they no longer have the same color, though I'm willing to get him the same board different color. \nNow, yesterday at the bus stop where are kids get on/off together, I told her I'm ordering the skateboard. She asks if I ordered it yet. I said, \"No, because I just want to make sure it's a color your son wants.\" She then tells me, \"Well, if you can't get the same color, it's okay. We'll just take the cash for it.\"\nThat just gave me a weird feeling. I'm happy to replace the skateboard, but don't like the idea of just giving them cash instead.

I work weekends so I\u2019m always pretty busy but I had two dates that would be the best time for a dinner or something like that since me and my fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t want anything too big. We said we would be happy with a few drinks and not a party with lots of people, we only wanted something low-key since we\u2019re both not really outgoing people.\n\nThat was fine, I told my parents and my mom picked one of the dates. To be very clear, it was agreed that this would be a dinner with only close family on my side, just a dinner with drinks and nothing else.\n\nThen a couple of days ago, in front of most of my close family, my mom announces that we\u2019re having a party in our house which includes my family and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s. Everyone is really excited about it and my sister asks if she can invite her friends as well. Me and my fianc\u00e9 are taken aback and don\u2019t really know what to say and since I\u2019ve been put in an awkward situation, I kind of agree to keep everyone happy.\n\nI talked to my mom later privately and told her again we didn\u2019t want a big party and she agreed, saying it wasn\u2019t going to be \u201cthat big\u201d. I asked how many people would likely be going and she said as many as you want, then listed off all the people on my side that would want to come. I tried to explain that my fianc\u00e9\u2019s close family is quite big and they would not all fit in our house (We both still live with our parents but are trying to move out soon) but she kind of brushed it off and said that we could invite whoever we want.\n\nNow this thing we didn\u2019t want is growing arms and legs. My sister is inviting her friends who are wanting to get their hair professionally done for the party when I\u2019m not even going to that effort myself. A distant family member is coming over from another country and people I barely know from distant parts of my family are asking if I\u2019m having something and giving me very generous engagement presents. It made me and my fianc\u00e9 feel quite uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nI just want to say that we do appreciate that people want to celebrate the fact we got engaged and it\u2019s nice of them to sort of organise something for us but not to this extent. We would probably have to book a venue and catering for all these people going now and we really don\u2019t want to spend massive amounts of money since we\u2019re trying to save.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 says we should just cancel everything and tell everyone the party is off but I\u2019m more reluctant since I don\u2019t want to offend anyone. So we\u2019ve decided to take it to reddit because we\u2019re both suck on what to do and how to handle this without coming off as complete assholes. \n\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I point blank cancelled this unwanted engagement party?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

People frequently ask how tall I am, which I am perfectly happy to answer in normal conversation. It usually leads to sports talk, which I am more than comfortable in because I played sports and follow quite a few pretty closely. However, I feel that sometimes my privacy/personal space gets invaded with people asking me, and I will dismiss the question. This includes people interrupting phone calls, tapping me on the shoulder when I have headphones on, walking down the street having conversations with other people, but also times where I'm simply existing and can see them staring at me while they think about asking.

I don\u2019t remember the exact words, but here\u2019s the general gist.\n\nMom: where were you?\n\nMe: what do you mean?\n\nMom: your location was off. \n\nMe: I didn\u2019t realize, I turned on airplane mode to charge my phone faster. \n\nMom: you can\u2019t charge your phone when the car isn\u2019t on. \n\nMe: I thought that too, so I checked with [bf], it works on his car.\n\nMom: I\u2019m going to try charging my iPad in the car without turning on the engine. \n\nMe: your car is a different model than his, it might not work.\n\nMom: it doesn\u2019t work, I tried on all 3 cars\n\nMe: like I said, his car is a different model\n\nMom: what car does he drive? \n\nMe: *gives make and model of car* why are you interrogating me?\n\nMom: maybe if you used some better excuse. \n\nAt this point, I felt hurt. I said that there was no reason for her to be questioning me like this, especially after I had already explained to her what had happened. I said it was really hurtful that she would accuse me of lying or \u201cmaking excuses\u201d when I went out of my way to keep her updated. She ignored what I said and even went on to say \u201cnext time he\u2019s here, I\u2019m going to try charging my phone in his car when the engine is off, to show that you\u2019re lying.\u201d \n\nI was really upset my mom didn\u2019t seem to trust me. I told her that until she was ready to apologize and treat me like an adult instead of a criminal, I didn\u2019t want to talk to her. The next morning, when she tried talking to me, I ignored her. When my dad finally asked if we got into an argument, my mom said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. She\u2019s mental.\u201d My frustration boiled over after hearing her dismiss my feelings in such a demeaning way. I ended up crying and tried to explain what had really happened to my dad. I barely got two sentences out when he cut me off and told me to apologize to my mom. When I refused, he said that I was ungrateful.\n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA. Yes\nB. No\n",

I was planning on having lunch with an old friend of mine when she asked if she could bring a friend.I was totally ok with it since I'm always excited to meet new people. She arrives and my friend has to leave due to an unexpected family issue (she wasn't playing matchmaker, it was a real problem) for about 2/3 hours. The mutual friend and I have a great time and get to know each other and we exchange numbers in order to go out sometimes as friends\n\nFast forward no less than 5/6 months when I get a notification on my phone from that mutual friend asking if I was free that weekend to go out. I was taken aback since we hadn't talked in forever but I agreed.\n\nWe get there and after some small talk she \"confesses\" that she wanted to go get dinner with me because I'm a great listener and seem like a level headed person.This wasn't the first time I heard that, but I was still wondering what she had to tell basically a random stranger to whom she talked to once.\n\nThen she goes off : apparently she hadn't contacted me in months because her bf did not allow her to make new friends, especially dudes. They were on a break now which is why she, and I quote, \"Had the nerve to go out alone with a boy\". I was shocked.She goes on to say he constantly hurt her physically, emotionally toyed with her, threatened her,broke things in her home, would not let her go out, etc. I explained how she was in a VERY dangerous relationship and that she did the right thing by leaving him.\n\nThen she said in very sad tone \"Doesn't matter , I love him and we'll be back together soon\".Her situation was deplorable: she knew what kind of a relationship she had, however she was convinced by him that he was all she needed and ever will deserve. I tried talking her into going to the police , or her family. She bluntly refused and told me she just wanted to talk to someone, that being me, but not doing anything about it.\n\nI didn't personally knew the guy, I had buddies who did.I asked her if she was ok with me talking to him about all of this to which she firmly said \"no\". She told me how he has HUGE anger management issues and that he'd beat me. First of all, it wouldn't have got to that, and second, even if it did and I had to defend myself I'd have no problems (The guy was an absolute joke). After a bit more of her telling me what an ass the guy was, telling me about his threats of hurting her if she didn't act as he wanted, we both went home. I tried contacting her to see how she was doing after about 1 week and I received a text telling me they're back together and that she HAS to block me. I contemplated talking to the guy but I figured all of that'd go back straight to her and so decided I had no way of doing anything, after all, we were all adults and I had no real connection to any of them.\n\nThis situation keeps coming back to me every once in a while and I wanted to get some opinions on what happened.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I laughed aggressively loud and said, \u201cHAHA well thank god she\u2019s dead then!!\u201d \n\nAwkward silence and I ended up leaving shortly after.  Mixed reactions when I tell the tale; my sisters are split on if I\u2019m the asshole, my best friend says I\u2019m not, but my dad definitely does.

My problem isn't huge, but it's been bothering me for a while.\n\nAbout me: I have chronic insomnia, yay. I'm also a light sleeper and I work a 9-5 office job. I'm usually up between 6-6:30 in the morning.\n\nAbout him: he's self employed so his hours can vary, but the earliest he usually works is 9am. When he's not working early in the morning he will often stay up late watching TV/YouTube/gaming until he passes out.\n\nThe problem: this happens probably 2-3 times a week. He will pass out on the couch while watching TV, then once he wakes up (anywhere from 2-6am) he will come to bed. That's not the bad part. The bad part is like what happened this morning.\n\nHe came to bed around 4:30. Of course this woke the dog up who came over to give him kisses. Then he starts *talking to the dog like I'm not right there beside him trying to sleep!* eventually he rolls over and goes to sleep too.\n\nThen it gets worse. If I don't wake up when he comes to bed, I will when he starts snoring, which is always about 1.5-2 hours after coming to bed sometimes I will have *just* drifted off after being woken when he came to bed only to be woken again by his snoring. This means if he comes to bed at 4am, I'm up at 4am.\n\nWhile I wanted to smother him with a pillow (joking, of course) I just got up because there is zero point in staying in bed to listen to that nonsense. \n\nObviously this is really annoying and its cutting into my sleep which affects me during the day.

I was raised to learn 4 languages and honestly that messed up my processing of wording in the long term during elementary and middle school (Thanks Father). But nevertheless it is something that helped me get connections. Now even though I was never very connected to the hispanic side of my bloodline, I kept family connections and when I decided to move to the United states when I became a mormon I sough to take an uncle of mine's offer. Over years through teenhood and later on adulthood my uncle and aunt helped me a lot to gather myself and become independent. Now the hispanic community in highschool and beginnings of University were very warming, very family oriented and I became very comfortable with it as many of my friendships were hispanic. But over the last few years I have witnessed some harsh entitlement over the same community. As if instead of trying to ask if someone speaks spanish before, now it becomes more of a demanding request. I even heard one of my friendships complain when we went to a restaurant about why they didn't have a spanish speaker on the clock. It made cringe and also become completely offended. I couldn't help myself but distance myself from that idea and eventually at one of my jobs, as I interacted in customer service with many spanish speakers that were nice, the entitled and harsh ones would always out do the nicer ones by one against 5 or 7. It was like they were reproducing. One day I had enough and just took a deep breath and decided to stop speaking spanish. I avoided it for years. And whenever I would see people on that job start asking for me to speak I would swallow my desire and just answer back \"I don't speak spanish miss/sir\" Over time I developed a bit of a jerky tone with that when people out of nowhere just rambled in spanish to me not even asking if I spoke spanish. Mind you I don't look hispanic. A lot of people say I do look european but honestly I just thing I look more armenian or middle eastern because of my facial structure (Thanks mother). With people like this I would just stare at them firmly and ask with a firm \"what was that?\" if they changed back to english I would pretty much help gladly, but if the rambling continued with that demanding tone I would just keep the \"I don't speak spanish\" I am done with customer service now but from now and then I still encounter people around that do this and I respond the same way.

Not super strange but some things I noticed: \n\nShe\u2019s obsessed with everything being clean and perfect hygiene, \nShe insists on going to bed no later than midnight. If we\u2019re out, she insists she has to get home before 11:30 even on the weekends.\nShe refuses to sleep with her phone in the room and charges it in the kitchen (even though she has roommates).  \nShe has this super bright \u201ctherapy lamp\u201d by her desk that is supposed to simulate the sunlight and \u201cmakes her feel better\u201d. \n She is a super healthy eater who likes to eat at exact the same time every day \n She takes like 8 different medications in the morning (she said most of them were supplements)\n\nNone of this really affected our relationship and I assumed she was just a really organized person. \n\nLast weekend we were out at this fancy club for one of her friend\u2019s birthday. We were having a really fun time but then at 11:15 she said she had to go and get to bed. I was a bit disappointed since we were having fun but I offered to go with her. She said I could stay and she didn\u2019t want to bother me since she was just going to sleep.  \n\nAfter she leaves I start talking to Eve\u2019s friend Lea and joke about how Eve sleeps so early. Lea laughs and then says she thinks she started doing it as part of her mental health recovery.  I had no idea what she was talking about and ask her what she\u2019s talking about. Lea was surprised that I didn\u2019t know and starts telling me about how Eve really struggled in the past with severe depression and basically dropped out of college and stopped talking to everybody for years. People thought she had disappeared. Around 2 years ago she started reconnecting with all her friends and telling them about her struggles with depression and how she was doing therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. She soon started school again and became really obsessive about doing everything perfectly but she\u2019s doing so well now. Lea acted like it was no big deal but that it was weird I didn\u2019t know since most people knew. \n\nI was shocked. The next day I \u201cconfront\u201d Eve about why she never told me about her past with depression. She gets really defensive and just goes on about how Lea is an \u201cobnoxious gossip who never shuts up\u201d. I\u2019m pretty angry at this point because she\u2019s talking about her friend gossiping instead of her keeping a huge secret from me. She says I\u2019m being an asshole and have no right to be mad and that she was \u201cobviously going to tell me\u201d and that she was just scared and waiting for the right moment. She then insisted that she\u2019s better now so it doesn\u2019t matter anyway.

It should be noted that we have multiple people in other positions, like maintenance and management, who have previously worked as dishwashers and could cover, but corporate doesn\u2019t like us to do this because it costs them overtime. I refuse to miss out in a vacation I\u2019ve planned for months that\u2019s already paid for because someone else walked out that had nothing to do with me, but I also don\u2019t want to leave my boss and my job short staffed.

My (F52) daughter L (F28) tagged her housemate who is literally the laziest person I've ever met. He doesn't help her cook, clean, he doesn't work, he manipulates her to do everything by herself and then tells her \"she didn't have to do that\" because he was 'going to do it' and she has no right to be upset because \"He does things without praise all the time!\". He even refuses constantly to help her carry the groceries from the car up the stairs to her house and L is physically impaired. He's quite simply put - a leech. He can only pay rent from government money and doesn't do much more. L works 40 hours a week and still has to come home and do everything while C tells her \"I'm hungry\".\n\nI didn't see the original comment - I just saw it hours later that \"L commented on (movie theatre's name) post\" in my notification I didn't see that the movie theatre had already commented with a winner at first (they don't reply to the original comment, but simply tag the winners in a new comment at the bottom of the comment list) - and only saw my daughters original comment. So I replied and said \"Are you serious? C is the least helpful person I know. He is lazy, manipulative,  disrespectful, argumentative, doesn't help you do anything - not even bring in the groceries and you're disabled - or pay his way. He is the least deserving person you know to go with you! You could have picked anyone else!\".\n\nL had actually won the competition (not sure how exactly it works) - but after my comment was made, less than 20  minutes later, L called me, crying and yelling saying that the cinema had deleted their comment and redrawn prizes saying that there was a \"mistake\" and the winner was actually (random girl). L thinks I'm an absolute asshole for doing what I did and that I have no idea how much this would have meant to L and C and how dare I hate C for \"no good reason\". I told her I hate C because of all of the above reasons and she told me that she \"never said that\" and that C is an amazing person.  L claims she's also had a couple of messages from friends asking if she's in an unsafe relationship and if she needs to be 'rescued' from C - which was, in L's words \"completely humiliating\".\n\nSo AITA?

My best friend recently got a boyfriend, and he sleeps over in her room every night of the week (we have single rooms).\n\nSome new girls moved in this semester, and they like it cold, so my friend and I bargained with them that they wouldn't move the dial past the middle mark between \"Cold\" and \"Hot\". Cool, we all agreed that if someone is too hot, they open the window in their room to let in the freezing air outside.

They agreed to open their windows if its too hot, why can't you?\n3. I don't sleep in pajamas, maybe you guys should try sleeping with no blankets or clothes to reduce how hot you get.\n\nHer corresponding responses were:\n\n1. But I can't sleep when it's hot, and someone keeps turning it up in the morning, so then I wake up. (Plot twist I was the one who was turning it back up to half way)\n2.

I tell her she should wait until the rice is done or almost done because what she\u2019s frying is going to be done long before the rice. she gets a little frustrated angrily turns of the burner and goes to the room. \n\nI chill and play games waiting for the rice to ding and when it does she comes out and we both go to the kitchen. She begins frying the sprouts again very briefly while I prepare something else and then she turns off the burner and set them aside.

So I give up and take them off the heat and put them aside. \nWhen everything is done she puts all the sprouts on my plate. We sit down to eat and I\u2019m intentionally avoiding the nasty bitter raw sprouts and she takes one off my plate and eats it and says \u201care they okay? they\u2019re not very good\u201d So I said \u201cno I think they need more time to cook because the middle won\u2019t cook fast enough.\u201d And then she shouts \u201cwell how should I know?!

What are you even talking about? No I mean frying them doesn\u2019t work.

I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t really cook them through by pan frying them until I tried it!\u201d And she still not getting what I\u2019m trying to say answers back \u201cit\u2019s because you told me to wait for the rice!!\u201d And I\u2019m like \u201cno!

And all 3 were talking about useless gossip and about prom next year and who would be prom queen. \n\nI just interrupted and said \"Girls, none of this high school drama matters\". My sister objected and said its important to her, but I continued. I said \"When I was your age, I was thinking about college. I had great plans for where I was going to be. And now look at me...I'm successful and I got to party. You lot are obsessed with meaningless shit that doesn't mean anything. You need to think about where your lives are heading before it's too late\".\n\nThen I left. But after my sister confronted me and she called me an asshole for what I said but she started crying.

Given this statament, \"AITA for texting a stranger? | I was on the website of a pastor I enjoy listening to. He had posted about something that happened to him recently and the page allowed for comments so I went down to see what everyone else thought of his post. He's one of those pastors who likes to travel to small town churches and guest-speak. A lot of the comments were anonymous but a few of them had accounts with photos. One of them, we'll call her \"Betty\" had commented praising the pastor for his post, mentioned that they had met when he preached at her church and she felt like they had a connection and she wanted to speak to him and reconnect. Betty's profile picture and the general tone of her comment gave me the idea that she might be elderly. Based on her photo, she seemed like she was at least 70/75.

These are all pages with no privacy settings, anyone can see them.\n\nAnyway, I noticed a lot of trolls in the comments on the pastor's page saying some pretty awful things, commenting mean things to other commenters and I got a little worried that one of them might send \"Betty\" some nasty texts. I've been doxxed before and had some truly terrible things sent to my phone that resulted in me having to get a new number.

Apparently doing so is harassing and stalking. I tried to apologize and explain why I had text \"Betty\" but her male relative wasn't having it and threatened to call the police on me.

My mom and dad had two children and one died from a peanut allergy when she was a young teen. Anyways, since then they put flowers on her grave and visit it at least every month. I also am still living with my parents and am not going into personal details about my living situation other than that. \n\nSo around April 2018 I wanted some flowers for my bathroom. Fake flowers. Never had any in my bathroom growing up when every family member in the house had them. I figured why not make my own bouquet? So I went to Michaels and picked out very detailed, realistic, extravagant flowers with long stems. They were beautiful and $17 each with tax which is a lot for one flower and I bought 3 since they were big enough to fit the vase. \n\nAnyways, fall came and in September I took those out and put some fall ones in. I put the nice ones in my closet on some racks I had so they wouldn\u2019t get crushed. \n\nWhen fall went away I decided I missed the flowers and figured I didn\u2019t need to decorate my bathroom for Christmas. I went to get them and they were gone. I searched my entire closet, bedroom, and even under my bed. I asked my mom if she had seen them. I asked my dad. Nothing. \n\nYears go by and I finally got myself some new flowers. They\u2019re pretty....but weren\u2019t as pretty as the originals and they stopped selling the original flowers at Michaels. These looked like very obvious fabric flowers. I still would ask every 6 months if she had seen them, showing pictures. \n\nWell, just this morning, I was in the garage and saw the bag that has the flowers that usually goes to my mom\u2019s daughter\u2019s grave. I noticed a familiar flower. I opened the bag up and found all three. The petals were bent, crumpled, and the stems were covered in dirt. That\u2019s $51 down the drain in flowers that I only paid that much because I thought they\u2019d last years. I didn\u2019t even get half a year with them. \n\nI was angry and confronted my mom about lying. I remember exactly were I put my flowers, I NEVER would have put them in a dusty garage, and no one else but her ever goes in my room. Which meant she purposely took them and put them in the garage. Probably forgot they were mine and used them in for her grave. \n\nShe got defensive, said I must have put them in the garage and \u201cwhy does it matter so much?\u201d I asked why there was dirt and she said she stuck them in the ground around her daughter\u2019s grave. I was shocked. She called me selfish. Asked me why can\u2019t I share with her dead daughter. \n\nI was angry because I\u2019ve been asking her for years with pictures if she\u2019s seen my flowers. And there\u2019s no way she could mistake mine for hers- mine had giant long stems and vert detailed while the flowers my mom uses for her grave are those bundled fake pink roses you get at the dollar store that they keep out front. \n\nAITA for being upset about this?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. \n\nToday it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled.

It got nasty.

I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess.

I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible. \n\nBG info: So I love Indian Cuisine even though my stomach can't handle most of the spices well the pain afterward is worth it in my book lol. I happen to grow up next to a lovely Indian family, I became best friends with their two daughters and their mom became a bit of a surrogate mother for me as my mom was a single parent that worked long hours. Takes a village right? Anyway, I spent as much time over at my friend's house as at home if not more and was even learned how to cook a few meals. One of my favorites is makhn murg or better known as butter chicken. \n\nSo about a month ago I hosted a dinner party for my friend's group maybe (12? people) this included individuals SO's or whomever they wished to bring as a plus one. So the main dish I served was naan and butter chicken, along with a vegetarian curry dish. One of my friends we will call him Mac brought his new GF \"Ann\" along. \n\nAt first, Ann really seemed to enjoy the dishes I provided, I mean she ate two helpings. When she was on her third helping she asked what restaurant I had ordered from as she wanted to order from them as well in the future. I told her I made it actually, that it was an authentic Indian recipe even explained where I had gotten it from. \n\nAnn stopped eating and (paraphrasing) basically read me the riot act for cultural appropriation. How it was inappropriate for me to serve it and bill it as authentic Indian food. I (here is where I may be the ass) was so stunned that I started laughing and said are you serious right now? Don't you think you're being just a little bit ridiculous? \n\nWell, Mac and Ann ended up leaving in a bit of a dramatic flourish. The evening went on and though most of my friends agreed with me Mac sent me a text later telling me how insensitive I had been and how I was in the wrong. I reiterated that I didn't feel it was appropriation but appreciation. I didn't profit off of it in any way and I feel they were massively overreacting. \n\nBut Ann and Mac, clearly feel I'm the AH here that I should have served something else for dinner, and the cold shoulder I've been getting ever since is starting to make me wonder if I was in the wrong here.

My girlfriend is a gamer, I suppose. She grew up playing video games and she's always playing them when she gets the chance. Me, not so much. I grew up not playing games, but ever since we started dating, it's something fun we've done together, and I honestly enjoy it. I feel like it's something healthy for the both of us. In turn, she's also taken to my interests as well, such as baking and snorkeling. \n\nNow here is where the issue arises. My girlfriend has no shame in calling the characters she plays as \"hot\". In one game, she'll purposely put the camera under the characters skirt before the character moves away. In another, she'll comment on the characters hips and thighs and call him \"swole\" and pretend to drool. She'll always comment on any character if she finds them attractive and is always saying she would \"smash\" them. All in all I sort of find it as inappropriate behavior, so I called her out on it one day. I told her how it made me feel, and she said she was sorry saying \"Oh it's just a joke. Don't worry.\" When I asked her to not do it anymore she said okay. \n\nBut one day when I came home from work, she was on mic with some online friends again and she was telling her friend to pan the camera around the characters chest, which was nearly out in full display. I confronted her about it, and she said it wasn't a big deal. I told her she promised she wouldn't do it anymore, but she retorted that when I wasn't home, she could do as she liked, and the only reason she didn't do it around me was because she saw it made me uncomfortable. I told her that's not the point. The point, I told her, was that she had no shame in ogling other people's bodies knowing she had a partner. She said that it wasn't like she was displaying that sort of behavior around people we knew in public, unless they were close friends that knew how she was. We went back and forth a bit, and at the end of it she looked at me as if I was crazy and said okay. \n\nShe still does it from time to time, though I can see she tries not to do it when I'm in the room.

We were 5 meat eaters and two vegetarians. I decided to make empanadas. So I made about 25 meat/chicken empanadas and 10 cheese empanadas. So everyone could eat 5 empanadas ideally. I love to cook so it's not a problem.\n\nWhen they all arrived I was taking out the second sheet of empanadas and started to put them on different plates. 1 plate for Chicken one for meat and one for cheese.

One of the meat eaters wanted to take one of the cheese empanadas and I told them that I had just made enough of them for our two vegetarian friends. They looked kinda put off at me and just took one of the other ones. So the night progresses and one of the vegetarians comes up to me and asks me if I had made anymore of the cheese empanadas because their tray only had 3 left and both of them had only eaten 1 per person. I was kinda shocked because I had made enough for everyone and it wasn't such a big get together that people wouldn't have heard me. So I paused the music and reminded the people that the cheese empanadas were only enough for 2 people and to please be more considerate of others. I was a bit annoyed by this point but let it go.

My family doesn\u2019t have celiac so they still eat gluten. I do get frustrated with them sometimes, because they\u2019re very careless and often leave crumbs everywhere or use my pots and pans (I have separate ones to avoid cross contamination). I\u2019ve never asked them to stop eating gluten though. The only thing I ask is that they don\u2019t use wheat flour, since it gets EVERYWHERE and can stay in the air for hours and hours after using it, which I can get sick from if I breathe it in (it has happened multiple times before). Of course they don\u2019t really listen though.\n\nAnyway, my dads birthday was the other day. He asked if I could make him a cake, so I did. But, of course, it was gluten free. I love my dad but I\u2019m not going to make myself sick by baking with wheat flour, it\u2019s not worth it. They can be kind of weird about gluten free stuff, acting like it\u2019s poison or something.

My dad is the only one who doesn\u2019t act like that, so that\u2019s the only reason I even tried making a cake. \n\nBecause of this, I didn\u2019t tell my family the cake was gluten free. They all ate it and loved it, didn\u2019t say anything about it being gross. Later that night my mom found the package for the gluten free flour in the garbage. She asked if I had used it for the cake and I said yes. She immediately told the rest of the family, and they\u2019re all really mad at me for \u201cforcing\u201d my diet on them. They said they thought I had grown up by now, and wasn\u2019t doing that anymore. I find this very irritating, especially since only my parents ate the cake!

Her wedding was outside, and it was a very strict 50 person invite limit. My friend only invited 50 people for a reason, she told everyone before hand, they could not bring an additional guest. Well this lady brought someone anyway and caused a big mess at my friends wedding. She only had enough plate settings, chairs to watch the ceremony, and food, for 50 people. \nAfter the ceremony was over, we all started sitting at the tables outside to enjoy the meal. As everyone was sitting down, it was obvious there were not enough seats. She wasn\u2019t the only person to bring someone else, so people were just standing around, sharing seats, and eating with their hands. This lady sits across from me and I hear her starting to talk shit about my friend who just got married. She was saying how she couldn\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t plan for enough people, and it was tacky that people were having to eat with their hands, even though SHE is the one who brought an uninvited guest.

I noticed something move in her hair, and carefully watched the best karma unfold. A spider (not huge) walks up to this loop, jumps inside, and started spinning a web.

Here we go:\n\nSo I'm a guy who usually keeps my head shaved/buzzed or bald as often as possible, mainly because of my hairline. The part that grows though does grow fast.\n\nAt work though I usually wear a hat mainly because (in addition to the above reasons and wanting to look good) I work outside and I sunburn easily. Occasionally (And rarely) after I shave/buzz I'll work without it and wear sunblock instead.\n\nSo there's this girl at work (I'll call her Dani) I've known for maybe a couple years. I don't think she's on the spectrum or anything, but I feel like she may not be all-there in social situations, definitely heard her say some things that were weird or off. Also I barely know this girl, I've maybe had a few extensive conversations with her, but never hung out outside of work or anything.\n\nSo today was one of those days I just recently shaved and decide not to wear my hat and let it all hang out. Dani is there, she immediately sees me, doesn't miss a beat and blurts out, with a smiley/cheery tone \"**Hey! Wow what happened to your hat? Aww, you look better with your hat on!**\"\n\nOf course I'm kinda shocked and taken aback by this comment, I don't need to explain why. Dani, however, was confused and didn't seem to understand why that's such a weird thing to say. She supposedly meant it as a 'complement'. So to that, I responded with - wait for it - saying she looks better with makeup on. I mean, I figured it was an appropriate analogy, basically telling someone \"you look better when you mask one of your natural features\". And yes, I'm well-aware how it would make most girls feel.\n\nShe actually didn't seem bothered by that comment, but other people who heard me kinda did. Honestly I don't actually think that, but I wanted to make a point of how it feels to be told that.\n\nShe then actually responded with something even weirder - basically telling me that \"she's reached the point where nothing from me would affect her personally\" because of how long we've worked together. That was kinda surprising since I see her on the average of maybe twice a month and never hung out with her. She then went on to say something about \"don't you have those friends that are close and you can say whatever to... like tell them if they have a booger or if their fly is down\".\n\nAgain, kinda weird that she sees me as that since I barely know her but whatever. I don't agree with the examples she mentioned being analogous to what she said though. I mean maybe if an actual close friend said that to me it wouldn't be as weird, but would still be kinda weird.\n\nAITA for that comment though?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

With only her social security money coming in, she was in a bad way and couldn't afford her bills. This January she was very sick with cancer and I was in the position to buy a home. I purchased the home for above what it was worth because my aunt needed money. The house is run down, infested with fleas and termites, cat pee embedded into the grout and walls, a large neglected yard, and all surfaces covered in 20 yrs worth of a pack a day nicotine. I moved into one half of the house and my aunt had the other half.\n\nCurrently: She passed away last week. With no will despite all of the family begging her to make one for the past 4 months. She had listed me as POA and beneficiary of her bank accounts because she believed I would make the good choices about the money from the home sale. Before she passed, we had discussed improvements she wanted to do to the home, such as remodeling the kitchen because of a decade old leaky dishwasher that ruined the cabinets and wall behind them and rescreening the back porch (she placed a deposit on this before she passed).\n\nAbout 70k is left. About 4-5k is going to fix up her cats for adoption (they all 4 have several medical problems), 2k for the cremation, 10k to hold back for the family to come together and scatter her ashes sometime next year, 25k for me to fix the house, and 20k min for 8 of the cousins/step kids to split. There is about 9k left over that if no other expenses are foreseen, would also go into the cousin fund. So the cousins would get 2,500 -3,675 each\n\nThere is also an SUV that my aunt paid off and verbally said she would give to my mom. Mom thinks it is too big for her, so I offered to trade my car to her for the SUV.\n\nMy other aunts are mad because I am taking so much money AND getting the car. (The car was a deal just between my mom and I.) I need the money to fix the house into a livable condition and I would be doing most of the repairs myself to save expenses. There would be no money to split if I hadn't purchased the house. I feel that because the house needs so many repairs and because my aunt was going to do these repairs if she had survived , I should take the money and get the house in good condition. If I had not wanted to help my aunt out of poverty, I would have purchased a home that was in good shape. \n\nMy other aunts want the ~55k to be split evenly between just the 6 cousins, leaving out my uncles kids from a previous marriage. The step kids got nothing from their father's death and I felt they should get something.\n\nSo, AITA for using about a 1/3 of my aunt's money to fix my house?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

This happened on the weekend, which was my 20th birthday (btw - drinking age is 18 in my country; Americans always get on me for this).\n\nI love champagne, but only buy it when I have something to celebrate (i.e the end of final exams or a birthday) since it's so expensive (& I'm a broke student lol) & makes it feel more special. I also usually only drink about 1x a week as drinking much more often than that can make me not feel great. Anyways I bought champagne this weekend to have for my birthday. My parents & I sat down before dinner for 'happy hour' which is pretty much a weekend tradition in my house. I asked if they wanted any but they said to save it for myself & they had wine instead. Cool more for me. My parents aren't as big on champagne as I am anyways. \n\nMy (30M) brother came out of his room after we'd been up there for \\~30 minutes and asked what we were doing & could he have a drink. My parents said sure the wine is on the counter. He asked for the champagne. Here's the thing about my brother - on numerous occasions in the past, he's drank other people's alcohol on them. Drained the bottle. He barely pays for his own food or alcohol but always takes others. I find it so annoying & this is why I didn't want to share with him, but I would've been okay sharing with my parents. \n\nI told him no I bought it myself special for my birthday. He said it's not like it was a gift & asked if I was really going to drink a whole bottle of champagne tonight (tbf - it was NOT a full size bottle but a mini - there's 2 MAYBE 3 medium sized glasses in it). I said no but whatever was left I could drink tomorrow. He said it would go flat. I said my champagne stopper works pretty well. I reiterated that it was expensive & this was something I bought special for myself for my 20th. He said \"I bet you offered mom and dad some\" I admitted that I did but they said no & they're a different case anyways so I decided to keep it for myself. He claimed again it would go flat. I snapped and said \"I would rather drink flat champagne tomorrow than let you have any.\" He accused me of being rude and went back to his room.\n\nAITA for how I handled that? My brother just acts like he's entitled to everyone's EVERYTHING (food, alcohol, etc even if it's labeled) & I didn't want to share with him on my birthday.

I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. \n\nI opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.\n\nShe reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that \"I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had.\" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.\n\nSince her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. \n\nNow that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to \"force myself\" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. \n\nBut I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors.

We got along well, enjoyed each other, and after about a year despite taking precautions, I got pregnant. We hadn't specifically discussed what we would do, and to make it more complicated, we found out early on that I was pregnant with twins.

He\u2019s happy to just send me the money and forget about it. He says he is still happy with this arrangement, as am I. \n\nOther than the bills, all of our finances are completely separate. We have separate bank accounts, we both work and both make close to the same amount, but recently I\u2019ve begun making more than him. We could both support ourselves if we lived alone, with some left over. We aren\u2019t rich, but it\u2019s not like either of us is living paycheck to paycheck either. In the past, the only purchases we had to check with each other on were things that affected the other person, such as a new pet, new furniture for the main area of the house, etc., because that\u2019s common courtesy. \n\nRecently he\u2019s been wanting us to have a joint bank account where we put all our savings, and to talk with each other before making expensive purchases. When I ask him why he says he wants us to be better at saving money, and he wants to feel like we\u2019re building a life together. He never used to care about what I spend my money on, but recently he\u2019s begun getting annoyed when I make expensive purchases. We own our house and are not planning on having children so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a joint expense we both want to save up for. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to change the way we handle money. I\u2019m better at saving than he is. He pretty much just blows his money on whatever after the bills are paid, and I put a good amount into my savings account each time I get paid. He doesn\u2019t have any savings, I do. I don\u2019t care what he spends his money on as long as the bills get paid, which they do, and I\u2019m feeling annoyed that he doesn\u2019t extend me the same courtesy anymore. It bothers me that he\u2019s begun complaining about my expenses, even though they don\u2019t negatively impact him at all, and I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea of having a joint bank account since we have very different ways of handling our money.

Given this statament, \"AITA for telling someone their mom is paying me to hangout with them? | I (19F) am a current college student and work on the side as a babysitter/nanny. I got a message on Care.com of a mom asking if I was interested in hanging out with her son and helping him cope with his general anxiety, prepare for college, and have experience being social. I told her I was definitely interested and the mom and I arranged a time for her son and I to go out to get lunch. I drove over to the boy\u2019s house to find out he was the same age as me (previously thinking he would be around 10/11 age). The boy definitely had a lot of anxiety and was a little awkward. I asked him what his mom told him about me and he said, \u201cthat I messaged his mom and I was looking to hangout with someone and do fun things because I am lonely.\u201d After we awkwardly hung out for a couple of hours, the mom told me not to come meet her as she doesn\u2019t want him to know that she and I are still in contact. She then PayPaled me $20/hour for hanging out with her son. She asked me if my friends and I were interested in all hanging out with him and getting paid. We all did this a few times and individually got paid the same hourly rate. After a few times, I found this to be saddening. As someone who struggles with anxiety, I would be destroyed if I ever found out that my only friends were getting paid to hangout with me by my mom. But would definitely want to know this to grow and not feel so blinded and sheltered. \n\nI ended up telling the boy what his mom was doing after many times suggesting to his mom that maybe she could tell him that I am peer mentor but not his friend, because this would probably be embarrassing and hurtful information for him to find out one day along the line.

I think lying to him about having friends is possibly a patch in the present, but definitely going to be a bigger issue in the long run.

We live apart and spend nights together when we can. Unfortunately, we end up spending most nights apart. We have both said we don't like this. However, being busy professionals, we deal with it.\n\nGF got a new job in the spring as a project manager for a shipping association. She's been putting together industry events, organizing tours for various ships, etc. These events almost always occur away from our home city. Some of them are quite far away (travel by plane), but others have been in driving distance (around an hour).\n\nOn the occasion that the event has been closer, I've asked if she could consider staying at home or if I could drive up and stay with her. She's always refused. Her reasoning is that she's going to be way too busy with work, and will just be crashing at the hotel (or place she's staying).\n\nRecently, an event she was organising came up in our city. Two weeks before it, she let me know that she would be staying at the event site. I asked her why, as the city transit goes there, and all together we're talking maybe 30-35 minutes door to door. I got the usual response. I asked if I could come and stay with her, she said no. I dug further and asked about the plans in the evening. The first night she says she'll be working late setting up, but then her portion will finish, so she doesnt need to worry about tear down. I ask her why is she staying there for an additional two nights, then? It comes out there are social events those nights. Events I'm not invited to. I say fine, doesn't feel great, but then can she please just come back home after the parties rather than stay at the site? She says no, she has to be back at the event in the mornings.\n\nI got upset.\n\nI pointed out it takes longer for me to get to work from her apartment than it would for her to get to the event, and yet I do this all the time. I pointed out that none of this is a reason I couldn't come stay with her. I pointed out she could just leave the social portion before it was 2AM and get a good night's sleep if she wanted. I pointed out we dont spend that much time together as is. I pointed out I am NEVER (not an exaggeration) invited to anything to do with her new job, when I am very conscientious to invite her to everything in the hopes she'll make it.\n\nHer response was to question why I can't just support her, and that this is what she feels she needs to be successful. I told her I would like to support her but these decisions seem less about work and more about socializing and convenience and they don't make me feel valued in the relationship.

My reasoning for this is:\n\n1. Just because they want to hang out with me doesn't necessarily mean that they want to hang out with my boyfriend at that time (for the record they like him). I feel like there are things that they maybe wouldn't feel comfortable sharing if he was there. \n\n2.

Also I remember how it felt when I was in their place and even though I was happy for them that they were happy I was also a little bit jealous and felt left out.\n\n3. I think that a lot of times people get into relationships and lose touch with their friends. I remember how much it bothered me when I felt like I was losing my friend to a relationship or when they would invite me out but I felt like a 3rd wheel. It's important to me to keep making an effort in my friendships and not give my friends the feeling that they're \"in addition to my boyfriend\".\n\n4. I feel like sometimes inviting my boyfriend changes the vibe of hanging out, and while that's totally fine, sometimes I feel like my friends want to just hang out \"the high school friends\" or \"just girls\". I feel like I also sometimes want this specific vibe. I remember how much it bothered me when I thought that I was hanging out with a friend and I showed up to see that her boyfriend had come along too, even if I liked him I was a little bit sad that we wouldn't have our own time together.\n\nOverall I love my boyfriend and things are great when he comes along, but I feel that it's important for me to sometimes prioritize just friend things.

My family member does have cancer. I don't currently go to family events but I feel it's unfair and maybe he should stay home sometimes so I can go. Before my gbs, I was fully vaccinated for travel, got every booster and paid for extras not covered by my insurance. My family has the argument that I'm selfish and the person with cancer might die - but anyone can die whenever and I'm missing out on the core family events\n\nI've seen a bunch of doctors for a long time. My case was interesting. Some say to never do a live vaccine again (gbs is autoimmune). Most say don't do a flu shot (a very weak link). Some say I'm fine for anything and it's just superstici\u00f3n. My favorite student doctor said it best \"this is hard enough, right? Why risk making it worse. We aren't sure you'd live a second time. We don't know if it's related to the flu shot but we do know it does happen to people twice\" \n\nIt's just a flu shot. Who cares? Our situations are equal in the end anyway. My family thinks since there's no real link between Guillian Barre and the flu shot I should just get it - that I'm being silly. But the doctor is right, I couldn't survive this journey mentally a second time so why take any risks. Maybe in 50 years we'll have enough data to say they're totally not related but it doesn't matter now. \n\nI think my family with cancer should sit the next family event out so I can go\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I get  a kick out of using hogtie on people during this game and prefer it to even winning the real target points. I just find it hilarious to do. Sometimes if people have a mic they get pretty irate. \n\nBut to me, it's just a GAME. It's just fucking around. But apparently some people take it a bit more seriously, some of my gamer pals said I am being a jackass by doing this during Master Archer. I am just thinking it's silly and having a laugh, not trying to be a dick, but is it really that rude to hogtie people during Master Archer?

Given this statament, \"AITA for calling the police/CPS on my SIL? | Going to try to make this as short as possible while including details needed. \n\nI have been with my fianc\u00e9 for 6 years. Fianc\u00e9 has an older sister, we'll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. \n\n2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby's dad, Sally's boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn't there for all of this. \n\nShe checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was \"fine and just needed a safe withdraw\". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don't think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don't smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. \n\nA week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fianc\u00e9's other sister's house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. \n\nThat was all last year. They've been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn't have the money because BF's paycheck got messed up and didn't go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. \n\nTwo weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece. Of course I'm not going to let my niece or sister go hungry, no matter what is going on otherwise, so I say I'll be over at 5. I got off work early and get there at 2:45. I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don't know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. \n\nI took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn't want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece's dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn't really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. \n\nAn hour later I get home and fianc\u00e9 asks me what I've done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was \"out of line and stupid\" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend's house and cried all night. I couldn't handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I'm okay. \n\nI turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fianc\u00e9, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece's life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a \"family affair\", and ruined Sally's chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally's jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.\n\nI am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fianc\u00e9), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.\n\nI truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I'm worried someone is going to come get \"revenge\" on me for what I did. I can't eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I'm not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I've had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I'm thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don't care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it's never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I've ever done is love her as my own. \n\nReddit, AITA?

I have never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because she has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. She will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. My son insists it's because shes shy but I think its very clear that she believes herself 'above us'.\n\nI also strongly susspect she is using my son for his money, she has almost no income, she works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. My son is in a well paid tech job and I think she is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. She jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because she had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.\n\nMy son was at my house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. We were discussing venues and I mentioned our local church, he told me that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as she wasn't religious, she wanted an outside wedding. I told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike my son as I've always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family. \n\nAt this point I was upset and hurt and told him that I didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and I didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this. My son got angry and told me that they didn't need any financial help, they had savings and Vanessa was planning to cut costs by making decorations. I said he was going to end up blowing all HIS savings and there was no way she'd be able to make all the decorsations with all the other things she'll be focusing on during planning so he'll end up paying for those too and they'll start married life with a huge dent in his savings which is just a terrible idea.\n\nHe then accused me of never supporting his relationship and told me if I wouldn't support his wedding then I might as well not come. I told him I might take him up on that as I don't support his attitude and maybe his own mother not wanting to come to his wedding will help him realise how ridiclous he's being about it. \n\nMy sons has told the family about it, several people are on my side, my parents and sisters also think he's being impractical and overdramatic, my husband is refusing to get involved at all but my other son and daughter are angry at me and are telling me I'm acting like an asshole.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My current BF, together for one year, said that he cannot be with me if I take this puppy.\n\nBackstory: I have raised a dog with my ex for 4 years until we split up and we agreed to give him full custody because he was more dependent on Rocky and I understood that it will be more convenient and best overall that he takes Rocky. I fought for him but we talked it out like adults. I have asked to see and hangout with Rocky from time to time because Rocky is a big part of me and my ex and I\u2019s relationship are platonic, nothing more than exes. He lets me see rocky and hangout with him here and there when I ask and I\u2019m so grateful for it. My current bf came into the picture post break up and I was going through a tough time but I fell in love with a new man who would father my kids one day. \n\nHe has a dog of 1 year and understood the situation and was okay with me seeing Rocky, kind of. He hates that I stay in contact with my ex because of Rocky but allows it, always telling my it\u2019s a tough part on him but he understood the situation and tells me that this would be the opposite if he wasn\u2019t a dog owner. Last month, my ex decided to put an end to the visits because he said it would be unfair to his new gf now. I was devastated that I was told I can no longer see Rocky. I can tell that my current bf is stoked at  the fact that it ended but not how it ended, and tells me why it had to be my ex to end it instead of me. He questioned if I even cared about him and how he was put in a place with no control and now feels better that I have no reason to contact me ex. My bf tells me this is a great chance for me to connect my his dog, but he sees that my heart will forever be with Rocky. I love his dog, but we all know it\u2019s not the same.\n\nThe problem:\nMy brother got me a puppy for my birthday and didn\u2019t consult with my bf prior and said to everyone that he\u2019s probably fine with it and it\u2019s ultimately my choice to decide.

I always tell him we are not ready for a dog until we move in, which is 1-2 years down the road, not now. The problem is I really want this dog and he gave me an ultimatum. He compromised and told me, we can go to the shelter and pick out a dog together and raise it together if I want a dog in my life, just don\u2019t take this one given how everything went down.\n\nI want this puppy, I can confidently say this will make me happy.

We only found out recently and she\u2019s the only one in the family. She normally lives in another city for university but she had to come back to live with my mother and I [16M] due to recent events.\n\nMy mother buys separate snacks for my sister since the \u201cnormal\u201d ones all have lactose. The lactose-free ones still taste good but they cost a lot more so my mother also buys the normal ones so that she doesn\u2019t have to buy more of the lactose-free ones. So, basically, only my sister eats the lactose-free ones.\n\nI suspect that my sister still eats some of the normal snacks since they have been eaten a lot more quickly ever since she moved back in and my sister does still complain about the intestinal problems that led to us finding out she's lactose intolerant.\n\nSo, the other morning, I got up to have breakfast and noticed that there were no normal snacks left. What I did notice is there were still two lactose-free snacks left. \n\nI don\u2019t normally eat the lactose-free snacks because it feels wrong since they were bought for my sister. My mother has never explicitly said not to eat them, but since my sister theoretically can\u2019t eat the others, I don\u2019t want to eat the lactose-free snacks since we have less of them. But there were two and I knew that we\u2019d buy food that day and get more. So I figured that if I ate one, she would definitely still have one for herself if she hadn\u2019t had breakfast yet and she\u2019d get more later on, anyway. So I decided to just eat one.\n\nI didn\u2019t think much about it until later on in the day my sister noticed and got really angry at me for eating her food. I explained that I didn\u2019t think it was wrong because it was one of the few things left and I didn\u2019t finish the snacks, but she said it\u2019s wrong in the first place for me to eat her food because she can\u2019t eat the other.\n\nI think I acted wrong afterwards because at that point I got angry at her and told her that it didn\u2019t matter because she ate the normal snacks anyway and it was her fault that they had finished when they were supposed to last us longer.

I think maybe I think she\u2019s the one who should apologise to me for getting mad at me over eating a snack. My mother even said that all the food is for everyone in the house and neither of us should get mad at the other for eating any of it when we\u2019re hungry. Am I really TA in this situation?

Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.\n\nSo I\u2019ll get right into it. I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by sleeping with some random bloke she\u2019d pulled in a club. I confronted her and broke it off. \n\nFast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as we\u2019re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which I won\u2019t get into, but safe to say she\u2019s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. \n\nWell a couple of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or 3am, and it\u2019s possibly important here to note that she doesn\u2019t have any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always the \u2018popular\u2019 social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship as, though she didn\u2019t like to admit it, she was always jealous. \n\nI went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I\u2019m quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the lines of \u2018drunk again?\u2019 With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself. I said it\u2019s not my fault she\u2019s a loner and that nobody likes her, we argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that\u2019s why she cheated because he was better than me, which really pissed me off.\n\nI mention how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with a girl I\u2019d brought home. She said she\u2019s glad she hurt me and asked if I\u2019ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her.

Given this statament, \"AITA for telling a scary story to my girlfriend's little cousin? | Last night my girlfriend was at her house and babysitting her young 5 year old cousin. Her parents and aunt and uncle were out for the night and she invited me over so that we could spend some time together whilst watching out for her cousin. I won't divulge his real name, but let's just call him Timmy. Timmy was actually well behaved throughout the night. He put his own messes away, he politely asked when he wanted something, and he was just an all-around good kid. When it came time to tuck him in, he asked me and my girlfriend to tell him a scary story. My girlfriend's mind was a blank and I didn't have anything to offer, so I just decided to improvise and make something up on the spot.\n\nI looked out the window and saw a streetlight and I got the idea to tell the story of a monster called the \"Bunyin\", a tall demon that disguises itself as streetlights during the day and spies on kids in the neighborhood to see which kids are bad and good. He doesn't do anything to the good kids, but when the bad kids are asleep, he drops the streetlight facade, reaches into their windows and takes them away to his underground lair. Timmy was noticeably creeped out, but I told him that he didn't have anything else to worry about since he was a good kid. We bid him goodnight and we hung out for a little while longer, but then Timmy starts screaming. We rush into his room and he's pointing outside his window...at a streetlight. He's crying and screaming \"BUNYIN! BUNYIN!\" We told him to calm down and that it was just a story, but he wouldn't settle down. My girlfriend told me that it was probably for the best if I left and I agreed.\n\nWell, this morning I got called to my girlfriend's house and her parents and aunt and uncle were waiting for me and they didn't look happy. They asked if I told him a scary story about the Bunyin and I said yes. They told me that the story caused Timmy to flee the house early in the morning and they couldn't find him anywhere nearby. They were about to report him missing when one of their neighbors came by with Timmy in his car and he brought him home when he saw him running down the street. I immediately felt guilty about that part and my girlfriend's uncle was really letting me have it. He starts telling me that it would've been all my fault had Timmy been abducted while running away. I argued that Timmy wanted me to tell him a scary story in the first place, but they didn't want to hear it. They asked me to leave and never come near Timmy again.\n\nEven my girlfriend made me feel like shit about it. Me and her both occasionally browse the r/UnresolvedMysteries page and my girlfriend said \"This is what causes kids to vanish and never be seen again.\" I tried to add some levity by saying \"Well, I guess we know why Asha Degree left her house.\" That upset my girlfriend even further and I admit that that joke probably wasn't needed, but I just want to know if I'm really at fault for what happened here.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

His PC is 7 years old and he's been wanting to upgrade for a while so he can play new games at high resolutions. I'm also a gamer so I understand the frustration of low FPS and ugly graphics however we bought a house last year and two months later he got fired so he wasn't eligible for employment insurance. I've had to pay for the bills for 6 months before he finally got a job again this year. During that time I paid for him to take a supplementary course to be more employable while paying for mortgage, his car payments, and literally every other bill. Luckily I have a good-paying job and an emergency fund so I was able to handle the financial burden. I was never mad at him for losing his job but I was upset and stressed that I was barely breaking even.\n\nAnyway, he started working again on January and I told him to keep his earnings for a few months so he can start paying off his car (4 years left) and start saving. He makes around $2k/month and his only bill is his car payment of $500/month but he still only had $1k on his account before the refund was deposited.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA for kicking my mentally ill sister out because she\u2019s so messy? | My (26f) sister (28f), Jen, has been living with me for a few months now. \n\nShe quit her job and uni in the past couple years, however resumed uni again recently and takes one class at a time. This was due to pretty severe depression and probably other issues (drinking heavily, major mood shifts) but she\u2019s never been diagnosed because every time we try to get her professional help, she isn\u2019t receptive and it always hits a dead end.\n\nFor a while, my parents were paying Jen\u2019s rent (they are financially pretty comfortable), but eventually it still became too much and we decided the best thing to do would be to have her move in with me, in my guest room. They still give her enough for basic living expenses, and started sending me a small monthly amount in place of her paying rent/bills. \n\nThe thing is, my sister is a slob- i get this is an effect of her severe depression, but she also won\u2019t follow through with help we continue to try and get her, so I\u2019m a bit fed up. \n\nWhen I say slob, I don\u2019t just mean clothes in a pile. She eats in her room and leaves the food out for weeks. I have found rotting food in every corner of the room, including THE CLOSET. There\u2019s countless carpet stains. Trash, empty bottles of liquor and clothes everywhere. \n\nWe\u2019ve had arguments about this and I\u2019ve given Jen many several chances to stop trashing my home. Her depression is always the excuse, and I get that it can be a reason for letting everything go, however the fact she still is resisting help for it just makes this more frustrating. \n\nI told my parents I\u2019m considering kicking her out, and they begged me to reconsider, saying she \u201cneeds\u201d me and she can\u2019t go live with them as they\u2019re in a retirement community. They pointed out that she isn\u2019t well and I should really just stick this through, that anything else would make me an awful sister (and an asshole). \n\nSo, WIBTA? \n\ntl;dr my sister has severe depression and had to move in with me. She is absolutely trashing the room I\u2019ve been letting her stay in (rotting food and trash everywhere).

Given this statament, \"WIBTA if a difficult family history makes me not want to reach out after a death? | I spent the first 20 years of my life aware that I had four siblings (from my dad\u2019s first marriage) but I never knew them due to issues they had with my parents and me by extension. Because of that, we were estranged.\n\nTwo sisters live in Florida, and when I was 20 (four and a half years ago) my dad started rekindling his relationship with the them. To show support for that, I did as well. I never felt comfortable, because of the history, but I tried my best to be as sisterly as an only child could be.\n\nLast summer our father died. Before the wake even happened, my sisters, brother and I went to dinner and other than \u201chello,\u201d the first thing my oldest sister said to me was: \u201chis money should be split between the five of us.\u201d That rubbed me the wrong way but I moved forward because I thought that dad would be excited to see all of his kids together getting along.\n\nAbout a month, maybe two months, after he was buried (September/October), this same sister posted on Facebook about how her ex husband wasn\u2019t treating all of his kids equally, and she went on to rant about how her \u201cbiological father\u201d treated only one of his kids well and ignored the rest. I have proof of letters, cards, etc he sent them asking to see them/talk to them that they blatantly ignored (they were adults when I was born). She continued to rant and just talked a lot of crap about my dad which really upset me for a few reasons: 1, as I just stated he didn\u2019t throw them away, and 2, he wasn\u2019t there to be able to defend himself against her nasty words; he was the best dad. \n\nThat night, I made the choice to cut off ties with all of my siblings for good. I was tired of getting upset about their BS constantly. Shortly after this, the same sister emailed my mother stating that she believes my mom is entitled to ZERO of my father\u2019s life insurance money/unpaid salary/etc because they divorced and that money should be split among his five children. My dad did not have a will, but his job informed us it was all left to my mom in trust for me. I initially wanted to send all four of my siblings some of the money, but that left a very sour taste in my mouth after my mom had set up all of the funerary arrangements so they didn\u2019t have to. We haven\u2019t spoken since.\n\nI am still friends with some of my nieces/nephews on Facebook because my problem is not with them. I saw that my oldest sister\u2019s son died this week. I saw that they created a gofundme page, so I donated because I want to help and he\u2019s still my nephew, despite me not knowing him at all. But I don\u2019t want to be in contact with her (or the rest of them for that matter) because they have been deliberately greedy and rude for most of the time I\u2019ve known them and I made a promise to myself not to contact them again after what was said about my dad. \n\nIf I don\u2019t call to send my condolences, WIBTA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

If someone says they have a stomachache, I will immediately panic and start giving them distance.

Yesterday 4 of us went to the beach. It was me, my girlfriend, my friend Gary, and Gary\u2019s girlfriend Zoey. We go to the beach often so I already know what Zoey\u2019s body looks like. I just never thought about commenting on it to Gary before. Well, yesterday we were in beach attire. The ladies wore bikinis. We all know that Zoey got breast implants when she was 18. She\u2019s really skinny so her boobs look really big and fake. My girlfriend isn\u2019t as skinny as Zoey and has small boobs. \n\n\nWhile my girlfriend and Zoey were chilling, Gary and I walked to a nearby store to buy something. As we walked back to the beach from the store, I didn\u2019t think what I said next was a big deal. The thought popped into my brain because I noticed my girlfriend peeking at Zoey\u2019s boobs a few times. I told Gary that it\u2019s funny how his girlfriend is skinnier than mine but has much bigger boobs. He asked me how that\u2019s funny. I asked him if he doesn\u2019t find it funny how Zoey is like half the size of most other women on the beach but has bigger boobs than most. He said that he still failed to see how that\u2019s funny. \n\n\nI told him that I have nothing against Zoey\u2019s body, but it\u2019s an extreme outlier. I told him I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll fit in better in LA or Miami than our redneck beach. He said that he knows Zoey is skinny and has fake boobs, but he still doesn\u2019t find what I said funny. I told him funny might not be the right word, but interesting. He said he\u2019ll tell the girls and ask them if they think it\u2019s funny or interesting. I told him to please leave them out of it since I don\u2019t want them to compare each other\u2019s bodies and make them self-conscious. He didn\u2019t acknowledge that and talked about something else. It was all chill for the next few hours. \n\n\nOn the car ride home, Gary out of nowhere told the girls about my observation and how I thought it was funny and interesting. He asked them if they felt the same way. The girls agreed that it wasn\u2019t funny or interesting at all, but rather weird and inappropriate. I defended myself that I only got the idea because I noticed my girlfriend staring at Zoey\u2019s boobs a few times. My girlfriend said that Zoey has nice boobs and she can stare, but it\u2019s inappropriate for me to comment on their boobs and body to Gary, and make it like a competition. \n\n\nI told her that I wasn\u2019t trying to make it a competition between her and Zoey, and frankly it\u2019s super rude for Gary to bring up our private conversation with them, knowing it will cause unnecessary tension.  My girlfriend said that it was good for Gary to bring it up because she needs to know when I\u2019m acting out of line. Zoey also said that she\u2019s glad to know that I\u2019ve been observing her boobs and she will cover up around me from now on. I told them that it\u2019s not that serious, but they wouldn\u2019t let me off the hook.

Due to laws in our country, my son cannot watch his sister alone, and I don't want to put that on him, but if I did leave them alone and something happened I would stand to lose custody of both of them. There's only a few adults they are comfortable with: my mother, me, my sister, their therapist, and that's about it.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA if I wore an above knee length dress to thanksgiving with religious family | This year I am hosting thanksgiving because I just bought a house so it\u2019ll be a housewarming party as well. Also it\u2019ll be a chance for some of my extended family to meet my husband for the first time. The thing about my family is about half of my extended family are Muslim. And pretty devout. However I am atheist and so is my husband. After I stoped being Muslim when I was a teenager my family would always continue to push their beliefs on to me and force me to pretend I was still Muslim when we were around other Muslim friends and family to keep them comfortable and not offend them. I would usually go along with some of it and dress modestly and go to them to the mosque or non denominational churches and just keep my lack of belief quiet. Mostly because I was a kid and lived with my parents or when I was in college, still depended on their financial help. \n\nNow I\u2019m 24 year old married woman. I have a career, my own home, everything is on my own now so I don\u2019t want to keep pretending with them and making myself uncomfortable for the sake of their beliefs. Why is ok for them to be comfortable but not me? Why is ok for them to push their religion on me but I have to be quiet about not believing in anything? \n\nI feel like I should be able to wear whatever I want in my own home regardless of who is coming. I am still on loving and good terms with my family but they will get upset if I wear a dress that isn\u2019t to my ankles. (We live in hot muggy Florida). If I wear it they\u2019ll try and defer to my husband and tell him to control me and make me dress modestly and that would force him to back me up and might put him in a bad spot with my family. \n\nAnyways my husband said just to give in for the sake of respecting them and it\u2019s only one day but I\u2019m tired of it. It\u2019s more personal for me to stand up to them and dress how I want. Plus it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be naked or wear booty shorts and a low cut shirt or see through clothes. It\u2019s a normal above the knee length dress for fall time. \n\nWIBTA if I wore the dress or not. \n\nTLDR: my family is devout Muslim and would have a problem with me wearing secular clothing even though thanksgiving is at my house and I am atheist.

I never really liked her then boyfriend, and never really supported the relationship. The guy can't hold a job, and there were many times that she had to have 2 jobs to pay his portion of the bills. Then they broke up and she chased after some other guy, and when he ghosted her, she was suddenly engaged to first guy and gave 3 months to plan the wedding. I was her MOH, and I live a few states away from her. So I kept my opinion of the wedding to myself. I offered to buy all the wedding favors, decorations, etc and she turned down every offer. \n\nWe got into several arguments because she said I wasn't helping like I should be, but being several states away, there was only so much I could do except for offer to help financially. And it honestly pissed me off that I was doing everything I possibly could and she still wasn't happy. \n\nFast forward, I go down for the wedding with my then 11 month old. Keep in mind that I drove 8 hours without my husband, with an 11 month old, for this wedding. I stayed in town for a week so that I could do all the bridesmaids events. I was staying with my parents, who still had to work. She was upset that I was bringing my son to everything, but then was upset if i said i couldn't do something because i had my kid. She genuinely was mad that my family wasn't available to watch him so it really felt like a lose lose for me. \n\nBachelorette party rolls around, we were all pretty trashed. She thought I was passed out drunk and started trash talking my husband. That was kinda the final straw for me. I have never trashed her now husband to anyone. He doesn't abuse her, doesn't call her names, so therefor it isn't my place to say what I think. So I was extremely upset. And the whole party her friend was asking me weird questions that you just dont ask in everyday conversation. The questions made it very obvious that she had been talking about me.\n\nI go to the wedding, give my MOH speech, and stayed the entire reception, where my kid wasn't allowed (kid free reception) but she wanted him to be a ring bearer (which is why i brought him out of town with me). That whole trip was hell on me physically and financially. So after all was said and done I decided to just quietly distance myself from her because I was so upset at how I had been treated for those 3 months. \n\nShe sent me a message asking why I've been so quiet and I told her that I thought she treated me really poorly and her saying that it was HER wedding was not an excuse to treat her best friend that way.

Given this statament, \"AITA For Being Mad At My Friend Who Stole My Art? |  \\~\\~\\~  \nSo, back in 6th grade, I had a little group of friends. It was a small group, but they were the closest friends I had. There were four of us, E, L, R, and me. For some reason, I was considered the \"artist\" of the group because of the drawings in the back of my notebook. E also wanted to be an artist, but L and R said her drawings weren't as good as mine,  \nI didn't think anything of it until my notebook, the one with all my drawings in it, went missing. I asked all my teachers if they had seen it, but they were all clueless. I was going to give up on searching for it until L told me I left in my desk in math class. A wave of relief splashed down on me. I knew that the drawings weren't good. But I still valued them as if they were priceless.\n\nThe next time I had math class, I searched my desk for my notebook, but I found nothing. It kind of broke my heart that my drawings were gone but I eventually accepted the fact that it was most likely gone forever. If only that was what actually happened. The next day, when I walked into school, E was showing off some drawings to R and L. I was happy for her until I realized that the drawings that she was showing off were mine! At first, I thought it was a joke. So I walked up to them and asked who's drawings they were. E looked me dead in the eye and told me they were hers. Even L and R backed her up. I reassured them that they were mine. But none of them would listen.  \nI was starting to get tired of her bullshit so I got all up in her face.  \n\"Those are MY drawings!\" I yelled at her.  \n\"No, they aren't!\"  \n\"Prove it!\"  \n\"I do all of these from a youtube tutorial!\"  \n\"Show me the video then!\"  \n\"I forgot what video it was!\"  \nAt this point in the argument, anyone with more than two brain cells could see that she was lying. But apparently R and L have none, and they yet again backed up E.\n\nI was so angry at all of them, but I was also hungry. So I grabbed a milk carton and tiny container of cereal, whilst still yelling at E. I was going to sit down and eat, but R walk right up to me and blacked my way. She began to yell at me. And I don't know why, but that was the last straw. I was done with this bullshit. I squeezed my milk and cereal with quite a lot of force. And surprisingly, the milk busted, and it got all over R's shoes. She got furious with me, I don't know why they were cheap shoes. She looked like she was going to hit me. But I decided that I had done enough damage, and walked away from her, L, and E.  \n\\~\\~\\~\n\nIn present day, I'm kinda still \"friends\" with L and E. R moved and changed schools. I forgave L, but I still fucking hate E and R.   \n\n\nIf you want more info about this, comment about it because I'm almost at the character limit.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I didn't tell him I was engaged but I forgot to take my ring off so he found out. Somehow he got the idea he'd walk me down the aisle. I told him my (step) dad would be doing it.

Then he suggested I make everyone happy and have my grandpa walk me. I told him I was uncomfortable with his emotions and needed a break. I cut him off.

I asked them all to leave and went to my manager's office until they left. More recently he showed up at my house with the daughters, his wife, and his parents. I asked them to leave and told Mike that I wasn't interested in knowing him. I didn't want him or his family in my life. He insisted I should at least try to know \"my sisters\". I told him I wasn't interested. I had a family, siblings, grandparents, and his family was not part of it. I told him to fuck off. He asked me about my wedding. I scoffed and asked if he seriously still thought he was invited. He asked me about walking me down the aisle. He was crying.

He left but he couldn't stop contacting me so I got a restraining order against him.\n\nSome of my friends have been in the know and I've been honest with them.

Given this statament, \"AITA for joining the military to avoid looking after my father? | So little backstory, I am a 24 year old female. I broke up with a long term boyfriend about 6 months ago. The break-up was very petty on his part, and was the reason that i lost a lot of my old \"friends\". I left everything behind when i left him and basically had to start my life over.\n\nAbout 2 months after i had broken up with him, i started to make some new friends and relationships. Some of these were military people who were in/thinking of joining the military. These people that i met gave me a lot of insight into what military life is like (job stability, challenging environment, getting to move and see some of our country, great pension, ect). These friends by no means painted a pretty picture, they also told me about some of the not so great parts of the training and job, such as, sleeping in the snow during a field ex. They gave me the tools and their own experiences to consider, as well, i did a TON of research on my own about the military and the job that it entailed.\n\nSo in June i decided to apply to join the military for HR (its something i am currently doing as a civilian). In my country it is a very long and tedious process. This process includes a knowledge test, a medical evaluation, an interview, and a lot of background and personal credit checks. I have also been physically training like crazy since this application to try to get in shape and gain as much muscle as i can before i get accepted in and have to go to basic training. So i have basically been working my ass off since i started this application process. If/when i get in, i will be posted away from my home province for at least a year to a year and a half at minimum for basic training and trade training.\n\nNow, this is where i am having unsure if i am being a selfish asshole for wanting to leave to join the military.\n\nMy father has a medical injury that makes it so he cannot live on his own. Currently he is living with my grandmother because hes still fairly young and does not qualify for getting put into a \"home\" per say. This was a decision that my family has made, and i am my fathers only child, also my parents are divorced. I told my family about me wanting to join the military , and they lost their shit. The one reason that they made clear that they didn't want me to go to the military was because they expect me to \"take over\" the care of my dad in the near future. I feel like this is extremely unfair to me because i have not even had a chance to live my life yet, start a family, and i just left a 5 year long relationship and had to start over. My aunt and uncle who are insisting that i take over this care, they have two teenage children, their own house, my uncle works from home, and they are way more stable to take over this care more than i am. This same aunt and uncle don't think i can handle a military environment as well. \n\nAITA for wanting to enlist to avoid having to take care of my father?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I didn't miss any, she was still short four dollars, which I told her again because she acted like she hadn't heard me. She stood there not saying anything and not moving. If she didn't have the money, she could have easily told me to take an item or two off and she would have had enough money.

We had a lot of people enquire, and wanting to look, but not until the next day.\nAnyway, it was around 9pm and this woman asked if she paid in cash, would we sell to her for a grand less than asking price, putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that she had \"cash waiting\". I asked MiL and she said yes as the car had no battery (which was in the ad). The woman then said she could come that same night, around 10pm and pick it up, with cash. Again, MiL said yes, although not super impressed about her coming that late, but she wanted the car gone. So, we started to make sure everything was in order with the car, double checking there was nothing left inside, my husband even went to charge the battery to see if it still worked so she could test drive. Etc.\n\nIt was around 10pm by now, and this woman messages me saying that she can't come now. But that she will be there at 8am in the morning, that way she could bring a battery with her. I say, sure, but is she sure about 8am as others are interested (which is true). She says definitely 8am.\n\nThe next moring comes, and not too long before 8am, woman messages saying she will be a little late. I say okay, thinking like 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe ended up waiting an hour, and we decided after messing around the previous night, and with other potential buyers waiting, that we wouldn't be selling to her.\nI messaged the woman and politely explained this, and that's where it went down hill.\n\nDirectly after this message the woman states that she is on her way, and that she just had to get the money out at the bank (although she apparently had cash waiting last night?).\nI say again that we are going with another buyer, and she doesn't seem happy, saying she's just near our street, and she had to get money out, got stuck in traffic, that I'm rude, and accuses me of being offered more, and that's the only reason why I am no longer selling to her (genuinely not why, we just didn't want to wait any longer).\nI calmly explain again why we went with another buyer, due to the wait, etc. and say goodluck in finding a vehicle.\n\nLooking back, I do feel bad, as I am not usually the type to say no, or change my mind. I'm usually a complete push over, and I do what I can to be helpful. But, I was already running late for things I had planned that morning, time is valuable, and I was not in the mood for people and their shit. Others were genuinely interested like I said, too. \nI also had a gut feeling that she was going to try to get the price down even more, or that she was going to cancel again and wasn't even on her way. She just had that vibe.\nI told her not to contact me anymore after she said what she needed to, and she thankfully didn't.\n\nWe ended up selling the car to a nice lady who paid only $500 less than asking price, and we bought a battery and installed it for her. So, it worked out in the end.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWoman organized 2 different times to come and buy a car with cash, canceled the first time, then left us waiting an hour the second time. \nI explain we're no longer selling to her due to this, and she makes up excuses and calls me rude.\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. \n\nNow, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. \n\nNow the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to \"see his side\", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2. Her intellectual disability/developmental delay is really mild and she's honestly more or less on the same level as other kids her age and always has been, so it isn't like she has really difficult to cater to special needs. He's tried using the \"problem child\" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa. \n\nTL;DR: my stepdad put me in care when my sister was born bc he didn't want to raise another man's kid now he had his own.

Given this statament, \"AITA for wanting to break up with my fiance because of his violent and destructive son? | I met my fiance 2 years ago and our love is like a fairy tale, everything seemed so perfect. I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had \"Josh and Dad\" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.\n\nJosh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said \"Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!\" And ripped the bill in half.\n\nJosh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. \n\nMy fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me \"I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings.\" Or \"It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies.\" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. \n\nI would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid. I think I need to leave, I don't think I have the emotional capacity to stay and deal with it. I want nice things again, I want my dog, I want to have kids someday.

I have short hair and often dress tomboyishly(is that a word?), also occasionally apply makeups to make my features more masculine to the point of getting mistaken as a guy by strangers sometimes. It is nothing complicated really, I just find myself looking better this way as I look awkwardly like a drag queen if I dress like a girl.\n\n\nWhile my whole class knows about me, there is one particular girl who(serious or joking) always assume that I am either a lesbian or a FTM in the making. She spoke as if it's already fact and decided without considering my opinion. When I confront her about this, her reply was \"But (my name), you play rough sports, you dress like a boy, you hang out with boys!\" And suggest me to sort out my own identity myself, which I rolled my eyes and just left her be, we were not close enough to be discussing my identity anyway. \n\n\nThere's recently a new guy who joined the class, a rather handsome one, I must say. We were introducing ourselves to him one by one as he walked around. When it was my turn, right after I told him my name, the girl called out :\"Don't get your hopes up, she's a gay!\" And the whole class laughed.\n\n\nI may be laughing along but in fact I was quite irritated. So I walked up to her, announced: \"Yups, and meet (her name), my girlfriend.\" And gave her a  quick peck on the lips. She could not break free before the contact because I am much stronger than her, you know. The class then laughed again with cheers and claps and the new guy joined them. That girl though, after the initial shock, ran out of the classroom.\n\n\nI heard later from the other girls that she developed a love on first sight with the new guy, and I completely ruined the first impression. According to them she had been crying in the toilet for hours(not true, she came back when the class starts but I get that exaggeration) My own friends were saying that I went overboard, and I feel a little sorry for that. Buuuut, it was not that she didn't ruin my first impression with the new guy too, even though he was not my type, and she had been assuming my identity for a while before that. \n\n\nTLDR: Girl keep assuming I am lesbian, told the new guy in class, and I kissed her in return.

She isnt terrible, everything she makes is edible but is far off from the standard I was used to. So, I started to give her pointers. After all she cant get better if she doesnt know that something is off. I would tell her whenever she used too little salt or too much spice, if something was a little burnt or undercooked, told her when I knew how to make the dish better next time etc. I would always eat all of it and say thank you so it was not like I was being rude about it.\n\nThe thing is that she \"snapped\" when my mother came to visit and I casually said that she could give my girlfriend some cooking advice. My girlfriend nodded and smiled and generally seemed fine in the moment but as soon as the doors closed behind my mother my girlfriend went ballistic, accused me of humiliating her and her cooking in front of my family and stormed off. Since then I apologised saying that I am sorry for giving her constructive criticism in front of my mom but it didnt calm her much and she still refuses to make anything food-related at home for me. I think she is overreacting, I never complained about her cooking or throw it out. I was just being helpful. I miss her cooking, not gonna lie, so I might as well ask here if I stepped over the line somewhere.
