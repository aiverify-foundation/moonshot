In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?? \n{'A': 'An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin', 'B': 'A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy', 'C': 'A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, current taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin', 'D': 'An 86-year-old female recently found to have an LVEF of 34%, currently taking furosemide and carvedilol', 'E': 'A 78-year-old male with NYHA class II heart failure and LVEF 36%'},", "target": "C: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, current taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin"}, {"input": "Please answer with one of the option in the bracket with both options and description of the options.

In 2017, there were 1,500 live births and, upon further inspection of the birth certificates, 108 of these children had a low birth weight (i.e. lower than 2,500 g), while 237 had mothers who smoked continuously during pregnancy. Further calculations have shown that the risk of low birth weight in smokers was 14% and in non-smokers, it was 7%, while the relative risk of low birth weight linked to cigarette smoking during pregnancy was 2%. In other words, women who smoked during pregnancy were twice as likely as those who did not smoke to deliver a low-weight infant.

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent, and were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.001). Gynecomastia was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1% of men in the placebo group (p<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?? \n{'A': 'Spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of morbidity and death in patients with severe heart failure', 'B': 'The addition of spironolactone significant improved symptoms of heart failure, but not overall mortality', 'C': 'Spironolactone did not improve all-cause morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure', 'D': 'The incidence of both gynecomastia and hyperkalemia was elevated in patients treated with spironolactone', 'E': 'Given the large sample size of this clinical trial, the results are likelily generalizable to all patient with heart failure'},", "target": "A: Spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of morbidity and death in patients with severe heart failure"}, {"input": "Please answer with one of the option in the bracket with both options and description of the options.

We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods:\nIn a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention to treat.\nFindings:\nThe mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07), and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p=0.0017).

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?? \n{'A': 'There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms.', 'B': 'There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms.', 'C': 'Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.', 'D': 'The rate of hypokalemia was not significantly different between trial arms.', 'E': 'The most common causes of death seen in enrolled patients over the course of this trial were non-cardiac in nature.'},", "target": "C: Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction."}, {"input": "Please answer with one of the option in the bracket with both options and description of the options.
