Of late, the parties have had disagreements in respect of the following incidents:\nThe company had entered into a contract to sell musical instruments to Ping MusicSchool Pte ltd (PMSPL) which then resold the instruments to its students. However, before the company received full payment, PMSPL went into insolvent liquidationand there   were no assets left  for distribution to creditors. Ting and Tong thus decide not to pursue the matter. Chiang disagrees and wants the company to takelegal action against Ping, the sole director and shareholder of PMSPL. Ping is a famous   musician   who   had   focused   on   teaching   the   students   of   PMSPL   and neglected the administration of the business thereby causing the business to fail. Chiang also blames Ting and Tong for signing the contract with PMSPL before checking its financial state and thinks they acted hastly because Ping is their friend. Can  the   company   successfully sue  any   person to recover its  losses? ",
            "target": "The company cannot sue any person to recover its losses. As a company, PMSPL isregarded as a separate legal entity under s19(5) of the Companies Act whereby itcould own property, rights, debts, and liabilities under its own name. Shareholders and directors such as Ping would not be held personally liable for the debts andliabilities incurred as a result of normal business operations. Therefore, as Ping was acting in the best interests of PMSPL and no fraud and dishonesty was intended tobe committed against the creditors, following the decision held in the case Salomonv A Salomon & Co Ltd (1897), the company would not succeed in the claim againstthe personal assets of Ping.\n\nIn addition, under s157(1) of the Companies Act, a director owes a fiduciary duty toact bona fide (in good faith) in the company\u2019s interests. As held in the case IntracoLtd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (1995), as long as the director honestly believesthat their actions are in the company\u2019s best interests, the court will not interfere with a decision that is arrived at bona fide \u2013 even if the decision turns out to be commercially ruinous to the company. In this case, Ting and Tong entered into thecommercial agreement with PSMPL, honestly believing that the sale of the musicalinstruments would bring about long-term sales and business relationships thatmight  create goodwill and  reputation among   other users and  students   for the company. Therefore, even though the decision to enter into a contract with PSMPL turned out to be disastrous  for the company to  the extent that  it had sufferedeconomic losses, Ting and Tong would not be held to have breached this fiduciary duty or s157(1) of the Act."

Of late, the parties have had disagreements in respect of the following incidents:\nSome time back, Chiang asked Ting and Tong to consider employing his son CC, an undergraduate at NUS. All 4 men at a party at Chiang\u2019s house where they discussedand agreed on the job scope and salary that the company would pay to CC after his graduation. Upon graduation, CC approached Ting and Tong to confirm the date that he should start work. To his surprise, Ting and Tong said that as nothing was signed, the company was not bound to employ him. As for the earlier discussions, Ting and Tong said they did not take it seriously and that it any event, CC had not yet done work for the company. CC is upset and is convicned that Ting and Tong aregoing back on their word because of their recent disagreements with his father. It isnow 1 year since his graduation. He wants to sue the company to get back 1 year of\u201clost salary\u201d. He also wants to claim all other expenses including medical expense she incurred to treat a mild depression that he suffered on being jobless. Will CC be successful if he sues the company?",
            "target": "CC will not be successful if he sues the company. For a contract to be valid and enforceable,   it   must   encompass   four   elements:   (1)   an   offer   expressing   thewillingness to enter into a commercial agreeement; (2) unconditional acceptance of the offer; (3) consideration for the promissory obligations; and (4) the intentions for legal relations binding both parties. Given that this is an agreement between Chiang, Ting, and Tong who are friends of domestic relationship, there would not be any intentions for legal liability to arise from the agreement between parties.Thus, there was no valid contract between parties.In addition, assuming that there is a valid contract between the parties, there was no consideration provided by Chiang for the job offer to be remained open upon graudation of   CC. Following  the  decision   that  was  held  in  the  case  Tweddle  vAtkinson (1861), CC was first not a party to the contract and thus according to theprivity of the contract, CC would not be entitled to raise a claim under the breach of a contract. Secondly, there was no consideration that flowed from him. Therefore, the promise to employ CC after his graduation would only amount to a gratuitous promise to Chiang. Moreover, for the loss of the one year salary to be claimable, it must be proven thatCC  did  rely   on   the   promissory   obligations  by   Ting   and   Tong   and   he   did   take reasonable   steps   to   mitigate   his   losses   such   as   searching   for   alternative employment during the year. Since he did not mitigate his losses at all, he wouldnot be entitled to claim for the above mentioned damage. Furthermore, given that the employment promise was not to provide leisure, entertainment, or comfort,non-pecuinary losses would not be granted by court, as held in the case Haron bin Mundir v Singapore Amaetur Athletic Association (1992)"

It has been stated expressly in the contract prior to its formation that \u201cif acancellation is received 1 month before departure, 20% of the sum would beforfeited, if a cancellation is received 2 weeks before departure, 50% of the sum would be forfeited, if a cancellation is received 1 week before departure,75% of the sum would be forfeited and if a cancellation is received at anytime less than a week before departure, 100% of the sum would be forfeited.\u201dSince this is an express term which does not go against Statutory Provision,public policy or is subject to some judicial control, the express term would bevalid and binding. Since it has been expressly stated that 100% of the sumpaid will be forfeited if cancellation is received at any time less than a weekbefore departure, Tom, having notified them of his cancellation only 3 daysprior to departure, would not be able to get any of his sum paid back if heterminates the contract. Also, the express term would be clearly interpreted by Tom, since the contractual terms are in English and that he had all the time and rights to double check with the express term if he was not able to interpretit. We may also want to take a look at the cause of Tom\u2019s cancellation. If the cause ofhis cancellation is a frustrating event, he would be able to repudiate the contractand claim for damages, which would be a refund of the sum paid in this case. Foran event to be frustrating, it must have been an unexpected event beyond controlof parties, after making of contract, which makes further performance of contracteither (1) illegal, (2) impossible, (3) radically diff (main purpose of the contract no longer attainable, but both parties must know) from what\u2019s originally envisaged byboth parties. We can immediately see that a break up with his fianc\u00e9 does not (1)make the trip illegal, (2) make the trip impossible, as he still can carry on with thetrip himself/ with someone else, (3) make the trip radically different, since he will still be experiencing a special in-house tour for 2 to Bali. Thus, the break up withhis fianc\u00e9 is not a frustrating event and thus Tom may not repudiate the contract and claim for damages."

            "target": "To decide if Lena, a third party to the contract, is able to sue for damages, wemust look at (i) parties to a contract (ii) express terms in a contract, and (iii) whether the exemption clause is valid. The contract is between Lena\u2019s guardian and At Your Service Pte Ltd, since it was her guardian her booked the tour and paid for it. The general rule is that only parties to the contract may sue or be sued on the contract. This is knownas the doctrine of the privity of contract. However, there are some exceptions whereby a third party toa contract may still sue. Under Section 2(1) of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, a thirdparty to the contract can enforce a term of the contract if the contract expressively provides for it or if the term purports to confer a benefit onhim. Section 2(3) provides that to be able to sue, the third party must be expressively identified by name, as a member of a class or as answering aparticular description. Section 2(2) provides that Section 2(1) would notapply if  on  the   proper  construction of  the   contract,  it   appears  that  the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party. One party may choose to assign his rights to another party without theconsent of the party   he is in contract with. In  practice, contracts often expressively state that there can be no assignment by one party unless the other party provides consent. However, in the transfer of his liabilities as opposed to rights, consent is required. None of the above mentioned 2 points have been included in the contract, and thus Lena, who is a third party to the contract, may sue. The contract also expressly states on the ticket that \u201cit is not transferrable or assignable\u201d. However, to see if an express term is valid, we would have to check if (1) it was introduced prior to the formation of the contract (2) if it goes against any public policies and (3) if the term is interpreted according to the context of the contract. In this case, although the term does not go against any public policies and is interpreted in the context of the contract, it was not introduced prior to the formation of the contract, and worse still, included in the ticket. . Referencing Chapelton v Barry UDC (1940), it was held that no reasonable person in the circumstances would expect to find contractual terms on a ticket and thus the express term was not valid. Thus, the express term to exclude transferability and assignability was not valid. However, since there was also no mention of any term to allow third parties to the contract to sue, Lena would not be able to sue   under   the   law   of   contract,   but   she   may   choose   to   sue   under   tort  of negligence. Taking a look at the exemption clause \u201cAt Your Service Pte Ltd would not beliable  in negligence  for  any  bodily  injury,  death  or  loss  of  property.\u201d,  wewould have to take a look at the conditions that make an express term valid again to see if this exemption clause is valid. To see if  an   express term is valid,  we  would have to check   if (1) it was introduced prior to the formation of the contract (2) if it goes against any public policies and (3) if the term is interpreted according to the context of the contract. Although   the   exemption   clause   was   stated   prior   to   the   formation   of   thecontract and that it has been interpreted correctly according to the context ofthe   question,   the   exemption   clause   is   limiting   it\u2019s   liability   as   a   result   ofnegligence for any bodily injury, death or loss of property. This is invalid under  the Unfair   Contract Terms Act Section  2(1)  and  2(2),   whereby  you cannot   exclude/restrict   liability   for   negligence   in   relation   to   personalinjury/death  and cannot  exclude/restrict   liability  in relation   to  other  losses(such as property damage) unless clause is reasonable respectively. Thus, the exemption clause provided in the contract is invalid. "

            "target": "To see if  At Your Service Pte Ltd is able to get out of the contract that they have with Company Y, we will look at the various ways At Your Service Pte Ltd may terminate the contract,   either   through  (i)  suing   for   misrepresentation,  or   (ii)   terminating  by   breach   of contract and (iii) types of damages claimable. To see if  At Your Service Pte Ltd may get out of the contract by suing for misrepresentation, we must first take a look if Company Y\u2019s actions can be considered as misrepresentation. In order for misrepresentation to be valid, a false statement of fact that is not a term must be made prior to the contract and induces the formation of the contract. As stated in the question, the certain international certification that At Your Service Pte Ltd must have been known to them prior the formation of the contract, and that it must have been induced them in forming the contract with Company Y. However, this may not have been the case, as stated that At Your Service Pte Ltd paid Company Y 20%more than market price, thinking that they are good. The statement in itself proves that At Your Service Pte Ltd did not do themselves due diligence to check if they were  really certified. Thus,  they may not be able to  sue for misrepresentation, although a false statement was made, it was not known by At Your Service Pte Ltd prior to the formation of the contract and it did not induce the formation of the contract. One way to get around this may be for At Your Service Pte Ltd to check when the false international certification on Company Y\u2019s advertisements were made known to the public. If they were made known to the public prior to the date of formation of their contract, they may claim that they were indeed aware of this false statement that induced them to form the contract and pay 20% more than market price. If successful, At  Your   Service   Pte   Ltd   will   be   able   to   sue   Company  Y  for   fraudulent misrepresentation   as   they   were   outright   lying   about   their   international certification and they would be able to rescind the contract and claim for any damages   suffered. However, if suing for misrepresentation is not possible as they were not aware of the false statement prior to the formation of the contract, At Your Service Pte Ltd may end the contract by stating that there has been a breach in the contract. At Your Service Pte Ltd may choose to repudiate the contract, by stating expressly to Company Y before the end date of the contract that they wish to end the contract. On the other hand, if repudiation does not work, they may wish to end the contract by stating that company Y has fundamentally breached the contract. In order for this to be valid, there must have been either (i) a breach in condition, (ii) breach resulting in serious consequences (if no breach   in   condition,  can   argue   that   the   breach   in   warranty   led   to  serious consequences   or   (iii)   contract   states   that   can   terminate   for   that   breach. Looking at the above, (i) there would be a breach of condition is there has been   an   express  term   in   the  contract   stating   that   the   service   provided   by Company Y must be of a certain standard, expressly stating what amounts to the standard that is expected. (ii) may not be possible in this scenario since performance of service is still carried out, albeit of a sloppier quality. Hence, there was no serious consequences that arose. (iii) is similar to point (i) raised earlier, in a sense that should there have been an express term stating that the contract may be terminated as a result of the lack of quality of service, At Your Service Pte Ltd would be able to terminate the contract as a result. Thus, the most appropriate way for At Your Service Pte Ltd to go about would be to try to repudiate the contract, and if unsuccessful, go ahead to state that Company Y has fundamentally breached the contract by breaching a condition/ stating that   there   is   a   clause   that   allows   for   termination   of   contract. Assuming that At Your Service Pte Ltd is able to claim damages, they should aim to claim for Unliquidated damages, which are damages that have not been pre-agreed by parties. To be more specific, At Your Service Pte Ltd should claim for financial loss as a result of wasted expenditure on finding another company to clean up what was not done properly/ poorly. In order to claim for unliquidated damages, the loss must be proven, which may be easily done if they have the invoice provided through engaging another company to clean up after   Company   Y."

            "target": "The issue is whether Ruth\u2019s father can commence legal action against John\u2019s father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel,  it has been determined that partial fulfilment   of   a   contractual   obligation   does   not   discharge   the   promissee\u2019s obligations. This does not just apply to debt situation but across contractual laws. In the Pinnel\u2019s case as well as in the case of Foakes v Beer, the court ruled that the partial fulfillment of a promise has no sufficient consideration. Both cases were widely adopted. In the CLPT case, while the majority of the judges adopted the principles set out under the Pinnel\u2019scase   and  Foakes   v   Beer,   Lord   Denning   opined   that   there   could   be   asignificant amount of injustice if the principle laid out by Pinnel\u2019s case appliesto all situations. The judge then set out 4  elements where the doctrine ofpromissory estoppel could apply and they are: (a) the parties must have anexisting legal relationship (b) there is a promise that is clear, unequivocal andcertain and intended to affect the existing legal relationship (c) the promiserelied upon the promise and altered his position and (d) it must be inequitable for the promissor to be allowed to go back on the promise. The doctrine of promissory estoppel as laid out by Lord Denning has been adopted by the Singapore courts. Given the above, it is likely that the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies here as John\u2019s father has made an oral promise to pay for the food   and   drinks   should   Ruth\u2019s  father   comply   with   his   conditions.  As Ruth\u2019s father has complied to the conditions laid out by John\u2019s father, it would be inequitable to allow for John\u2019s father not to honour his initial promise. Hence, I would advise Ruth\u2019s father to take up a legal action against John\u2019s father based on the doctrine of promissory estopped."

A breach of warranty will still allow for parties to perform the contractand any damages caused can be claimed from the other party for any loss or inconvenience. In some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether a particular term is acondition or warranty. In these situations, the courts approach the problem byviewing it as an innominate term. The effect of the breach of such a term depends upon the seriousness of its consequences. If the consequences are serious and deprives the injured party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, then it would be treated like a condition. Otherwise, it would be a warranty."
