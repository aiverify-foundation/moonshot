They stayed for a while talking and what not and then got up to leave. As one of my coworkers went to clean there table, so noticed a small bag on the ground. Once she picked it up she quickly realized there was weed inside the bag. Granted it was a crazy amount, probably a couple grams at most. I called my boss and he instructed me to throw it away, which I did. The kids then came back for the bag and I informed them it was thrown away in our dumpster (which is an area only employees can get into.) They proceeded to make a scene about it and I told them they were lucky I didn\u2019t get the police involved, considering they state I live in doesn\u2019t have any marijuana laws for recreational use. After I talked about the police they left while yelling obscenities at my and my co-workers.

I always get there with enough time because I hate being late - and even then I only made it inside the room a couple minutes before the movie started.\n\nSo the place is almost full and I'm on the right corner all alone. Then comes this guy and starts talking to me. Convo went like this: \n\n- \"Hey, are you alone?\"\n\n- \"Yeah, I am\" \n\n- \"Well, I came here with my friend but the place is full, we couldn't get tickets to sit together so would you mind going to my seat so that I can sit here with him?\"\n\n- \"Sure! No problem\"\n\n- \"Okay, my seat is that way\"\n\nAt that point he's pointing to the far left of the room.

There's absolutely *no way* I can do that in 10 seconds because the room is big, people are still going in and I don't want to miss a thing. So I tell him:\n\n- \"Sorry but the movie is about to start. If you had come here with more time and your seat was nearby then sure, I would move, but it's too late now\"\n\nHe proceeded to stare at me, complain to his friend that 'I wouldn't move' (said in a disgusting voice as if I was some sort of evil witch or something) and went out of the room so that he could go to his seat.

I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had \"Josh and Dad\" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.\n\nJosh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said \"Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!\" And ripped the bill in half.\n\nJosh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. \n\nMy fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me \"I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings.\" Or \"It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies.\" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. \n\nI would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid.

We went to a place called Cowles mountain which I guess is about 45 minutes away from the hotel downtown. \n\nWhen we got there it was pretty crowded and we saw a group of guys coming down who were just blasting rap music.

Given this statament, \"AITA for refusing to drive 11 hours to bring my sisters home after they refused to listen to me about their road trip? | My dad passed away last June from liver cancer. My family consists of me, my mom, and my 3 sisters. We all dealt with his passing in different ways and i'm probably the only one who is in a place to move on. My 3 sisters have been sharing family memories as a way to move on and through this they started talking about going on a road trip as a family. They wanted to take a few weeks and go to about 6 different places we went to as a family when we were all kids. I wasn't against the idea at first and was willing to go and my mom is house bound so she never could have gone in the first place. There are 2 huge problems that were apparent immediately though. 1st, they wanted to do it, in the middle of winter to go to a ski resort we went to as kids. And 2nd, they wanted to do it in my dads old van. \n\nI won't even touch the winter part, but I will talk about the van. It is a piece of shit. My dad owned it for over 20 years and he destroyed that car. He thought of himself as a \"do it yourself\" kind of man but for the love of god was he not a mechanic. He fucked that car up to the point it had to get a whole new engine, twice. The only reason he even got to keep that thing was because my mother could never talk  him into getting rid of it. \n\nEven during normal weather that thing always has a chance of just giving out, and it was the shittiest idea imaginable to take that thing out in the middle of winter. I tried my best to talk the 3 of them out of it, at one point over christmas I begged my sister to use my truck if they wanted to go but none of them listened. \n\nWell, last Thursday the three of them set off for two weeks on the road trip. And by gods mercy that van lasted until last night. I got a call at 2 am last night from my sister's crying saying that the van broke down and they spent over 6 hours on a abandoned road trying to get help with no cell service. They got picked up at around 1 am and driven to a shitty motel where they got a room with 1 bed. All 3 of them started crying and asking me to come pick them up. Honestly, I was the only one who could probably \"save\" them. They are all single and all of our extended family live much farther away.

I should mention here that S is a very heavy girl, and she probably didn't intend to be dressed inappropriately.

I pulled her aside and calmly told her that her pants were not fitting well and made her look inappropriate. I told her since there were people around we needed to fix it, and offered to let her take the rest of her shift off. Instead she called her father and had him bring a hoodie, which she tied around her waist, and finished working.\n\nToday my boss came to me and said she'd heard what I did to to S, and told me I have no right to berate volunteers-I did not berate her.

The lady on the machine next to me shot me a few dirty glances before loudly stating to nobody in particular that it was rude to watch things on your phone without headphones, and I know for a fact that she was watching one of the TVs and had put the volume up before I had turned on my show. At that point I turned off Netflix and quickly finished my work out, as I was leaving I noticed both TVs were up at full volume and she seemed to have no problem with it.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not caring for my mom? | I don't know how any of this stuff works but I'm just going to leave this here as I've been thinking about this for so long. \n\nFor context: My mom's married to my dad until now. Mom's been working overseas since I was 2 years old. My dad's been working overseas since I was 7. They had my brother around that time too. They work in different countries from each other. I'm a few years away from college. I'm living with my grandma (mother's side).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my mom has been gone for so long, I don't really feel anything with her. Yes she comes back home every 2-4 years, but during those times she comes back home, I don't feel as comfortable with her compared to my dad. \n\nMy mom also has a not-pleasant personality. Sure she's friendly, but whenever I tell her about my school achievements, (e.g. When I won first runner up in a school contest) all she says is: \"Why didn't you get the first place?\". I also discovered, when my dad showed me their text conversation, that she always talks shit about me.\n\nFast forward 2015, mom cheats on dad with a guy she met in the place where she's currently working. We just knew about it when she gave birth to their illegitimate child. My relatives were the first ones to know about it as my mother finally told them. They didn't want to tell me because they thought I was going to be mad about it. Jokes on them, 1st, my cousin told me secretly & 2nd, when I was on a call with my mom, I heard a baby crying. I asked her who was it and she just hung up on me.Basically, my reaction to my cousin first telling me and my relatives telling me about my half sister is this: okay. They thought that I was just reeling back my anger when in actuality, I just. Didn't care. When I received that news, it felt like they were just telling me gossip about the neighbor. Cute story, but I don't really care.\n\n2017, my mom went home in our country: this time with her new man and my half-sister! She even let the guy meet grandma. There was this whole drama about it but that's not the point. The guy hated my little brother and didn't let him near with my half sister. I hated that guy.\n\n2019, my mom had another child with the guy. Honestly I was expecting it. The only thing that made me mad was the fact that she and my dad are still married and she just... doesn't care.  The only thing my dad did was care for her and now, this.\n\nAnyways, in the past few months, she's been struggling in where she's working. She has a toddler and a baby with her that she needs to take care of, her 'boyfriend' is not really helping with the children, they always argue, she has 2 jobs that barely covers the bills, and she hasn't had a proper meal for long. When I heard about it, the only thing I thought of is: Karma.

I know they spoke poorly of me to the rest of his family or didn't mention me at all because on my wedding day (which they refused to speak to me at), I had a distant aunt ask who I was because MIL told her he was marrying his ex-girlfriend.

Overall, my grades all follow the same trajectory: low at the beginning, as I'm just coming out of a break, and then getting better and better until the final exam, which I ace. APUSH exemplifies this. What I usually do is bring it up to a B and then kill the final, which is worth a huge portion of our grade (relative to other classes). However, with online school, final exams are cancelled. We had only 2 big tests other than the final, but I knew I'd have to get like a 120% on both of them to get an A, which is obviously impossible given my teacher usually doesn't give extra credit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I figured out a plan: sometimes, if there's a low class average on a test, the teacher curves the test by so many points-- the lower the average, the more points she adds. If you already have a high scores and the extra points cross the maximum amount on the test, they're just entered as extra credit. So if I studied and got an A and then the test was curved, I might be able to get an A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, that means I needed to figure out a way to make a bunch of people fail really bad. I'm in 1st hour, and usually people in later hours rely on 1st hour to tell them exactly what's on the test so they can specifically study that. So I decided, if I fed them the wrong info and got some friends in my hour to play along, I'd mislead them and cause them to do badly. They did, and the test was curved, so I ended up getting a 125.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then, with a few friends, went to the teacher and told her how the bad test scores were indicative of online school severely being detrimental to our learning, so in the interest of keeping our grades safe, she should curve the next test as well.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA If I gave a bad review of my friend's book? | So a while back my friend wrote a novel and got it self-published. I brought a copy of the novel to support them and read it. The book was terrible. It reads like amateur fanfiction with blatantly copy+pasted elements from other books and TV shows in the same genre (fantasy). My friend is not a native English speaker and that's an obvious fact when you read their book, the prose of the novel jarring and awkward to read. The actual plot and characters are amateurish even in comparison to published books that I find to be terrible (like Twilight for example).\n\nMy friend is very, very proud of the book and wants to get it properly published. They're extremely enthusiastic that everyone should read it (but in a good willed, non pushy way) and gets very excited when someone does. Everyone who's read the book agrees that it's badly written but lies when they tell my friend about it since it's clear it would hurt them if they told the truth. Like with most self-published works, they're relying on their friends and family to buy it, so feedback is lot more personal. I didn't say anything after I read it because I didn't want to lie to them. They've already sunk a lot of money into getting it self-published in the first place.\n\nThey also seem quite naive about how the publishing industry works and are taking some pretty big missteps in that regard. It's like they're just following the \"how not to get published\" rules.\n\nI'm also a writer and semi-professional at it with a high degree in the field. Harsh \\*but constructive\\* criticism is part of the game. I really feel that someone needs to just tell them \"this isn't working, here's why\" before they sink more time and money into it (they want pay to have merchandise made). However, I know that telling them will really hurt their feelings, so I was going to write an anonymous review online (the coward's option, I know.)\n\nAnd on the flip side, if they want to spend more time and money on a this then why should I stop them? Perhaps they, against my strong beliefs, do get it published and it becomes a best-seller? Stranger things have happened.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I wrote an anonymous review of the book, or should I just let things play out?\n\n(Also, if you see any spelling/grammar mistakes in this post please don't say \"hey OP's being a hypocrite!\" Being inside all the time because of the current situation is destroying my brain, and I'm not trying to turn this reddit post into a career.)\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

And I\u2019m not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it\u2019s ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. \n\nWe have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband\u2019s fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. \n\nFrom that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He\u2019s even said on occasion things like, \u201c3 year old is my favorite.\u201d And, \u201cI don\u2019t like baby.\u201d It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. \n\nNow to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, \u201cWhat does it matter? He\u2019s already ruined it.\u201d I responded with, \u201cfunny story. It\u2019s actually 3 year old who broke it.\u201d \n\nMy husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn\u2019t trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don\u2019t like baby!\u201d He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old).

It\u2019s going to be our first child and we\u2019re both stupidly excited and terrified. I\u2019m working and she\u2019s a stay-at-home wife, soon to be stay-at-home mom.\n\nUnfortunately, however, I got fired. More specifically, my company terminates my contract with the end of October, offering a very generous severance pay.\n\nSo we made a decision \u2013 use the severance pay to allow me to stay unemployed for two months, so that I can stay with my wife for the final weeks of the pregnancy, the birth, and then the first couple of weeks of being with our newborn. I am now searching for a new job with the idea of starting in January 2020. She\u2019s totally on board with this and we\u2019re both very happy for this \u201cpaternity leave\u201d of mine.\n\nSo I got a job offer, and for all intents and purposes, it\u2019s a dream job that I had been coveting for the past several years. Great company, great position, amazing money (more than TWICE my current salary). Chances of me finding anything comparable right now are next to none. Normally it would be a no-brainer for me to accept it.\n\nThe catch: as part of the induction/training for this role, I would have to go on a 2-week business trip in the second half of January, abroad, potentially even to the US (I\u2019m in Europe), leaving my wife completely alone with a 2-month-old baby, and 2 dogs, for 2 weeks. I\u2019m VERY uncomfortable with this idea and it makes me feel at best like an asshole and at worst as a monster.\n\nImportant details: she would be pretty much completely alone and nobody would be able to help. Our families are not in the picture, they live too far away to be able to assist. We don\u2019t have any friends locally (at least not close enough to help with baby and house management), nor any sufficiently friendly neighbours. We have 2 dogs, and no garden, so the dogs need to be walked, at least twice a day. She would have to manage the baby, the apartment, the dogs, any shopping and what-not, cooking, and basically anything and everything else, all by herself.\n\nShe\u2019s saying she \u201cwill manage\u201d, she\u2019s happy that I got the job offer and is telling me I should take it. I\u2019m not sure she really comprehends the challenge of having a newborn in the house all by herself. I never had children of my own, but as a frequenter of r/beyondthebump, I\u2019ve read enough to be seriously worried.\n\nThe alternative is to ditch this job offer and keep looking for something that would not imply any frequent or long business trips, but the downsides are quite obviously also severe \u2013 the offer is just too good to refuse. She says I should take the job, whereas my parents share my concerns and told me it sound very selfish and irresponsible.

It's very 1980's; and outside of feeling a little overwhelmed when we will suddenly have 6-8 boys running through the house, it's a good life. That said, we have new neighbors and their kids are 3 to 6 years old and there are anywhere from 3 to 6 of them living there at a given time (must share custody of children based on the fact that they are only there some nights and most weekends). The challenge we're facing is that they have decided our front porch and ramped sidewalk are there favorite place to play...and considering the front of our house is nearly all windows, we can't ignore them. It's not uncommon to have a group of 5 or 6 children that we don't know playing on our porch...running, screaming, etc. The question is, AITA for not wanting kids I don't know playing on our porch and sidewalk when I try to relax after work or read the news on the weekend?

I have never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because she has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. She will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. My son insists it's because shes shy but I think its very clear that she believes herself 'above us'.\n\nI also strongly susspect she is using my son for his money, she has almost no income, she works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. My son is in a well paid tech job and I think she is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. She jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because she had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.\n\nMy son was at my house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. We were discussing venues and I mentioned our local church, he told me that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as she wasn't religious, she wanted an outside wedding. I told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike my son as I've always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family. \n\nAt this point I was upset and hurt and told him that I didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and I didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this.

Almost every night that he stays at my house he's up till at least 2am but usually three or four. I can't stay up that late. So anyway I'm asleep and he's in the room right next to me maybe 7 feet away talking in a normal conversation tone with his buddy online. the room next to me doesn't have a full wall dividing it so I can hear him as if he's in the same room next to me.

Given this statament, \"AITA For ruining my nephew's birthday party after I was mocked and made fun of by my family? | When me (20M) and my brother Steve (28M) were growing up, there was a lot of competition between us and I always felt that my parents/other family paid more attention to him. For example, his HS graduation was a bigger deal with lots of people attending, mine was just a quiet dinner. That was just one thing among many others.\n\nI know it's a bit petty, but I think I do hold some resentment. So Steve graduated from college years ago and it was a big deal since he was the first person to graduate in our family.  I am in college right now and have to take an extra year due to some other issues I am having and I've been frustrated about it.\n\nSo my brother has a 3 year old son, and was throwing a big birthday party for him. Throughout the party I was ridiculed, for example, in a conversation with my uncle and aunt, my aunt said about me \"well at least if this one doesn't graduate college, we'll still have Steve to celebrate about.\" \n\nSteve also made a few digs at me, saying in a supposed joking manner \"once you drop out, I'll get you a job to shine my shoes every morning\" and people around me laughed, including my parents. I was ticked me off because I hate being reminded of my failures.\n\nIn addition, when there were a few guests that arrived, they ignored me straight up completely and went to Steve even if I was standing right there.\n\nI got so fed up that I walked over to the birthday cake that was sitting on the table in the back and when no one was looking, I punched my fist through the middle of it, then I went back and joined the party.\n\nIt turned out to be a mistake since someone did see me and informed my parents. My parents called me outside and scolded me and told me I was being selfish, I told them I was tired of being mocked and how they were also just as bad for not doing anything about it.\n\nI was told to go apologize to Steve and try to make it up to him, and when we went back inside he ran over to me and asked \"what is your fucking problem?\"\n\nI told him that I hate being made fun of, but Steve did not express remorse and instead told me to go apologize to his son for ruining the cake, I told him \"you apologize first you fucking dickhead.\" His son was only 3 years old, so I figured he wouldn't even remember what happened, and I was mad that Steve refused to acknowledge his bullying.\n\nSteve yelled at me and kicked me out and at this point everyone was looking, I told him to go fuck himself and left. He hasn't talked to me since and supposedly told my parents that he is going to keep his nephew away from me. My parents are also on his side.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA. Yes\nB. No\n",

The most he will do is unload the dishwasher when told to do so.  He sleeps all day and only comes down from his room for meals.  I feel that it's important to say that he has high-functioning asperger's but that only affects his social skills.\n\nAnyways, I get yelled at by my mother if I sleep in, if I stay up too late, if I don't prove to her my homework is done, etc.  My brother doesn't get reprimanded for anything he does or doesn't do.  I have been fed up lately from having to live at home (I usually live in an apartment near my college), and this treatment hasn't made it any better.  \n\nSo, today I had enough of this and called my mom out for letting my brother be lazy all day and not getting any sort of reprimand.  I asked her if he knows how to cook anything other than pasta, she said no.  I asked if he knew how to make his bed, she said no.  I asked if he knew how to do laundry, she said yes but he can't fold his clothes.  I told her that she cannot expect me to do everything for him now, or later when he is living on his own.  She has mentioned in the past that it is my responsibility as his sister to always be there for him when her and my dad are gone, because he won't be able to care for himself.  Not to mention, she has told me that her and my dad will be buying him a condo for him to live in when he gets a job, while I'm told I get less than half of what he will get because I did extracurriculars in school that cost money.\n\nAfter I said all of this, she said that I am wrong in saying that and that I \"don't understand\".  I understand that my brother is fully capable of doing everything I am expected to do, yet instead he is babied and isn't expected to do anything.  I also understand that I will be treated unfairly even after my parents die because they are giving my brother more in their wills, because he \"needs more\".\n\nI assume that my mother thinks I'm an asshole for saying this, but I feel that I am justified for being basically punished my whole life for things that he is not expected to do.

We fight a fair bit and don't get along a lot but I don't hate her, and we both try to have each other's backs as much as possible. This whole issue started when she \"forgot\" to warn me that our parents were home when I thought she was looking after me so I skipped curfew (idk if she intentionally did it or not but I find it hard to believe she just forgot). Needless to say I was grounded and I was pretty pissed that she didn't text me that they came home early, and the fact that she made fun of me CONSTANTLY for that and it really pissed me off. I was out with friends so I wasn't home but apparently my sister come home high as a kite and my parents FLIPPED THEIR SHIT on her and grounded her for like 3 months. I wasn't home and had no idea what she was doing or unless I would have texted her. She has been pretty sad about this cause now she's gonna miss something for her dance team or something. I felt bad for her I really did but then I remembered how she teased me for being grounded and I did the exact same to her.

His girlfriend Annie 19F and I are friends too. We\u2019ve been doing a lot of outdoor activities recently. Yesterday, the three of us and a mutual friend 18M trekked a mountainous area. While we were trekking, we got to talking about Michael Jordan. Our friend made a comment about Jordan looking like he could defy gravity when he dunks or do whatever wizardry only he could do. I followed that up by saying \u201cAnnie\u2019s tits also defy gravity.\u201d No one laughed. \n\n\nHere\u2019s some necessary background. Annie was flat as a board a year ago. She got tastefully-sized implants. They\u2019re super round and look like two tennis balls glued to her chest. Plus, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to show them off. Like yesterday, she was wearing a drop armhole tank top with no visible bra showing. Thus, you could see much of her side boobs clear as day, even the minor signs of rippling. I\u2019m pretty sure she was wearing one of those stick on bra thingies. I don\u2019t objectify women. I support the female empowerment of getting breast augmentation and dressing the way she does around men. \n\n\nI don\u2019t recall ever making an unprovoked comment about her breasts with her within earshot. This must have been the first time. I was already thinking about how perky and gravity-defying her breasts were since I saw her roll up in that outfit, but it was in the back of my mind. What I said slipped out of my mouth partially because I didn\u2019t see it as that big of an issue. Which girl wouldn\u2019t want gravity-defying breasts that don\u2019t need heavy duty sports bras to restrain them during strenuous exercise? Plus, Annie usually doesn\u2019t take banter too seriously. \n\n\nBack to the story we go. Annie glared at me and said \u201cexcuse me?\u201d, and not in a lighthearted tone. I told her to please excuse my potty mouth because I really didn\u2019t mean to offend her if I did. She asked me if it felt awesome to say such a childish thing about her boobs. I told her that she should know by now that I\u2019m not the type of guy to objectify women and it was just an incredibly dumb blip that is in no way a reflection of my true character. She told me to just own what I said, apologize, and stop making a fool out of myself. I said I was very sorry and asked for her forgiveness. She said she\u2019ll try. \n\n\nMy cousin and our friend were virtually silent throughout that altercation. Annie was laughing and responding normally to those two guys, but whenever I said something that was funny, she wouldn\u2019t laugh, while the two guys did. I had to address her directly to get a word out of her mouth. It made for a quite uncomfortable expedition when this was supposed to be a chill day to exercise, explore, and de-stress.

They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. \n\nSo my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could \"call it even\" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan. So - is sister the asshole for even suggesting this - and is sister the asshole now if she (as she is currently telling me she wants to do) just stops talking to my parents in a couple of days because of it all?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Our grandmother recently passed away, and had given me, as well as my sisters, the same item (a watch) for our high school graduations. So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \\~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt so hurt.

I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. I thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for me and I had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for me to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. I let her know this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told all of that to my Aunt, and she proceeds to call me an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that I can't just not give my cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that I was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that I should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life.

Given this statament, \"AITA for deciding to not sell a car to a woman who didn't show up on time? | Not the most thrilling AITA story, but I am kind of feeling conflicted.\n\nLate last year my Mother in law wanted to sell her car, so we posted it for sale on Facebook. We had a lot of people enquire, and wanting to look, but not until the next day.\nAnyway, it was around 9pm and this woman asked if she paid in cash, would we sell to her for a grand less than asking price, putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that she had \"cash waiting\". I asked MiL and she said yes as the car had no battery (which was in the ad). The woman then said she could come that same night, around 10pm and pick it up, with cash. Again, MiL said yes, although not super impressed about her coming that late, but she wanted the car gone. So, we started to make sure everything was in order with the car, double checking there was nothing left inside, my husband even went to charge the battery to see if it still worked so she could test drive. Etc.\n\nIt was around 10pm by now, and this woman messages me saying that she can't come now. But that she will be there at 8am in the morning, that way she could bring a battery with her. I say, sure, but is she sure about 8am as others are interested (which is true). She says definitely 8am.\n\nThe next moring comes, and not too long before 8am, woman messages saying she will be a little late. I say okay, thinking like 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe ended up waiting an hour, and we decided after messing around the previous night, and with other potential buyers waiting, that we wouldn't be selling to her.\nI messaged the woman and politely explained this, and that's where it went down hill.\n\nDirectly after this message the woman states that she is on her way, and that she just had to get the money out at the bank (although she apparently had cash waiting last night?).\nI say again that we are going with another buyer, and she doesn't seem happy, saying she's just near our street, and she had to get money out, got stuck in traffic, that I'm rude, and accuses me of being offered more, and that's the only reason why I am no longer selling to her (genuinely not why, we just didn't want to wait any longer).\nI calmly explain again why we went with another buyer, due to the wait, etc. and say goodluck in finding a vehicle.\n\nLooking back, I do feel bad, as I am not usually the type to say no, or change my mind. I'm usually a complete push over, and I do what I can to be helpful. But, I was already running late for things I had planned that morning, time is valuable, and I was not in the mood for people and their shit. Others were genuinely interested like I said, too. \nI also had a gut feeling that she was going to try to get the price down even more, or that she was going to cancel again and wasn't even on her way. She just had that vibe.\nI told her not to contact me anymore after she said what she needed to, and she thankfully didn't.\n\nWe ended up selling the car to a nice lady who paid only $500 less than asking price, and we bought a battery and installed it for her. So, it worked out in the end.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWoman organized 2 different times to come and buy a car with cash, canceled the first time, then left us waiting an hour the second time. \nI explain we're no longer selling to her due to this, and she makes up excuses and calls me rude.\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song.

My sister has always been the favourite child, and is defended by my mother in all situations no matter how wrong she may be. My sister has been financially supported by our parents her whole life, and is currently the reason my father is unable to retire. I have very little respect for her. Despite this situation, I have made every effort to treat her well whenever we interact and I make sure I am not to blame for any breakdowns in the family.\n\nSince moving home a month and a half ago, my sister has been consistently antisocial and hostile towards me. In itself, that's fine, but she then runs to my mother, in private, to spin the story around and make me a problem. My mother then comes to me to give me a stern talking to, which significantly strains my relationship with my parents. Some examples include:\n\n\\- My sister said she wanted an Xbox controller to play a game. I had a controller lying around and told hr she is welcome to borrow it, but she declined (for whatever reason). A few days later she demands the controller immediately, except I am working (remotely) and do not want to look for it now. She ran to my mother to tell her I was demanding money for the controller (make her buy it) and would not lend it to her.\n\n\\- I was making coffee in the kitchen recently. My sister comes in and aggressively asks me when it's her turn, then leaves. She was in there all of 10 seconds and told my mother I was preventing her using the kitchen 'for ages'.\n\nI think my sister's lying, followed by my mother's validation is her way of coping with her own behaviour, which is probably easier than learning to co-exist with people. Anyway, I got tired of this cycle of bullshit and sent my sister a private message that read:\n\n\\> Stop lying about me to Mum and/or Dad. Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.\n\nThe work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.\n\nSo Reddit, in sending that message, am I the asshole here?

I invited some friends from my hometown and booked the rooms, since I get a big hotel discount. I worked overtime for 2 weeks and used the extra money as a budget to set aside for my weekend in the city. While we were out, I got a massive bucket drink under the agreement that everyone would venmo me for part of the cost split up equally. My hometown friends were also in agreement that they would pay me back for the room. As the night went on, one friend refused to pay for cover or drinks, and kept trying to tell everyone where she wanted to go and refused to go on my birthday, so I got fed up and told her if she didn\u2019t want to pay for anything and kept throwing a fit about going to where she wanted to go then she could go home, which she did. I paid for the rest of their covers because one of their cards wouldn\u2019t work and the other had to pay a huge service fee for withdrawing, under the agreement I would be paid back with venmo.

One of the people in attendance was my friend's new girlfriend of ~2months. She hadn't been to my place yet and hadn't met Cerberus.

I said no to putting him outside because it was chilly and that's not fair, but did concede to put him in the kitchen while we played games. I thought that was the end of it, but the GF later got up to go to the toilet, which meant she had to cross through the kitchen. While in the kitchen she began screaming and freaking out.

I argued this wasn't the case, he'd simply gotten up and come over because he was curious who was in the room. She insisted it was terrifying and I kept arguing that I *know* my dog, he's never bitten anyone in the four years I've had him and he's not vicious.

Nothing major happened (not that I or anyone can truly is going on in someone else\u2019s marriage). SIL and us are on good terms especially lately. However she is a self declared bitch. She can turn nasty in a second. I have always avoided her bad side until now. She has still sworn at me in a way no-one else ever has. SIL and BIL have 2 young kids.\n\nMy husband (32m), myself and our daughter (1f) are currently living in the 3 bedroom house my father-in-law built for SIL. SIL and BIL moved out of here last year July because she wanted to work from home as a dog groomer and security estate the house is built in would not allow that. \n\n(I did not want to move in here! I was worried it would get messy getting more involved with his family! Guess what... )\n\nSo we moved out of the house we OWN to RENT from FIL. At FIL and SIL\u2019s request/encouragement. At the time I told my husband I was concerned that SIL would regret her choice and try claim the house back. He assured he would not allow that. The house is bigger and nicer so I caved.\n\nFIL and my hubby run a business together. After 10 years of success the business took a major hit last year. Since the business is suffering hubby is only getting paid every second or third month. As a result hubby and I can\u2019t always pay the rent (Which is pretty freaking high). My salary currently covers my car payments, daycare, groceries, utilities, internet and a bit more but not rent. \n\nSIL and BIL very rarely paid rent here for 5 years. Our house is rented out until August.\n\nSIL has heavily relied on her parents and my hubby for financial support all her life. E.g. They paid for her college twice but there was no money for him.

If we live in the same house I can almost guarantee that we will not be able to keep peace because our lives are too different. \n\nObviously she is hurting now because she is going through a divorce. Her 2 kids are also caught up in this and deserve a home. She says BIL told her to get out and he doesn\u2019t care if she takes the kids or not.

When it came to thinking about doing my A-levels (16-18) it was looking quite likely that I would stay on at my local comprehensive. Most of the schools around me had poor performance at A-Level and were quite rough. However, there was a Catholic school that had a great college attached (one of the best in the country). You needed good grades to get in but also a 'religious reference' from a vicar, imam or whoever. You didn't need to be Catholic, just a member of any religion.\n\n A year before I would be applying, I started going to a church nearby and in fact went every Sunday for that entire time. I even went to a ten week course that the church encouraged new members to go to (it was called the Alpha course) where they discussed religious themes and what it meant to be a Christian. I was open to the idea of religion to begin with, but very quickly realised it wasn't for me. Truthfully, my only motivation for going was selfish as I knew I needed the vicars signature when college applications would come around. \n\nSure enough, when the time came I asked the vicar to sign my reference and off I went to the good school. I stopped going to church pretty soon after that and never really looked back.

I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school.

She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea.

My parents were paying for majority of our wedding, with my mom paying for the most of it. During the planning process, things took a negative turn. My mom was very controlling and our relationship deteriorated. It was to the point that I was having panic attacks whenever My mom and I would have conversations about the wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I would make decisions, such as the color scheme, that my mom would not agree with and she would make it known. My fianc\u00e9 and I were afraid that she would change everything due to us living so far away from the wedding vendors. I have examples if needed. My fianc\u00e9 and I did agree to a wedding venue in the South and for my mom to put the deposit down. My mom also purchased my wedding dress and stated that it was a gift. \n\nFast forward some time, my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to postpone our wedding until 2021 as we want to focus on purchasing a house and take control of planning/paying for the wedding ourselves w/o the extra drama. We agreed to pay my mother back the deposit for the venue and already paid her back half of the total. She is now asking for me to pay her back for the wedding dress which I do not agree with, as it was a gift.

Given this statament, \"AITA for Asking My Wife to Eat Her Breakfast a Certain Way | Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.\n\nThe kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour\u2026 It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!\n\nWe roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it\u2019s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.\n\nMy wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.\n\nI want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).\n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for shouting at my mother that her new belief (NATUROPATHY) is a scam? | To give some background to the story, my mother never worked in her life, my father was able to provide for the family and she preferred looking after us and the house. So after me and my sister left our parents home (I moved to another country, my sister in a small town nearby my parents), start working was not an option for her because she's now in her 50s with no skills and/or qualifications. I guess being alone in the house made her pretty bored and I think also a bit depressed. \n\nSo when she came up with this idea of going to this (very expensive) evening Naturopathy course, I was not totally against it although I thought it was silly. I just hoped it could be an hobby for her and entertain her. This was 3 years ago and I think things are degenerating. \n\nShe's now obsessed with gluten, she's not celiac or gluten intolerant but at this course someone told her that gluten is bad and causes every sort of disease so now she would not touch it and does not allow my father to touch it neither. She spends hundreds of Euros in vitamins and food supplements because apparently this cure everything and are detox etc. She believes that negative thoughts are also the cause of every sort of disease and that if you think positive and eat following her diet (which is just everything except gluten and sugar) you can cure every disease. This seems harmless because she's not sick. However, she recently convinced my grandmother to stop taking all her drugs (my grandmother is old and has some problems with her blood pressure, back, and lungs). She recently told my father to stop taking one of his medications (he has colitis) because apparently 'the doctor want to sell this medicine to take money from the pharmaceutical company\". And now she wants to spend 450\u20ac for a chromotherapy pen sold by a friend of one her teachers. This is just a pen with a light on top of it. And it's 450\u20ac for the beginner one. Then she needs to buy one for 1,500\u20ac. These are just few examples of her new obsession with Naturopathy.\n\nAfter realising things are now degenerating, I tried my best to explain that there are no evidences that the things these people teach her at this course work. That a pen with lights can't cure diseases and there are no researches made on any of the theories she reads about. I tried to convince her that my father and grandmother need their medications. I tried to talk rationally and be calm. As a result, I was treated like a close minded person that can't see over what 'corrupted people' (every doctor, scientist, pharmacist etc) tell me. \n\nAt this point I just lost it and started shouting at her saying Naturopathy is a scam and that people that are selling her the chromotherapy pen are probably laughing at her for buying a 'magic' plastic pen for a ridiculous price etc. She is now very upset and is avoiding me.\n\n\nSo am I the asshole for shouting at my mother that Naturopathy is a scam?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I've always been a single Dad since they were a toddler/infant.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI severely limit my sugar intake.  I rarely even eat fruit.  Rarely eat any carbs that aren't also high in fiber.  Its pretty much just meat and veggies.  I have raised my kids this way, more or less.  I think the sugar industry in the US is disgusting.  I think we're poisoning our kids and ourselves with how we've normalized the amount of sugar we consume.  Thats my stance, and I generally keep it to myself.  I'm not interested in criticizing others on what they put into their bodies as its none of my business.  In situations in which people try to force me to eat something with sugar is simply say, \"Can't.  I'm allergic.\"  And they immediately back off.  I learned this tactic after many conversations in which people were personally offended I didn't want to eat their donuts/cookies/cakes simply because I didn't want to eat sugar.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have ever been a parent of small children, you know that everyone loves to dig in their pockets and give your little kids sweets. \n\n This old half-wrapped werther's original that some stranger pulled out of their pocket covered in lint, I'm supposed to let my kid eat?  I always turned them down by saying my kids are allergic to sugar. Worked perfectly.  When the kids first started going trick-or-treating I said the same thing.  I took their bags and told them since we're allergic to sugar, they can only eat 1 candy a day...maybe 2 on days they're really good.  Shit lasted the whole damn year (I always checked expiration dates).  We all have other food allergies too, so it was easy to get them to believe me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even remember specifically telling them they're allergic to sugar since they were like 6.  We just lived our lives relatively sugar free.  But fast forward 20 years.  We're at a holiday get-together and someone offered my daughter, now 25, a slice of cake.  She says, \"I can't.  I'm allergic to sugar.\"  Later, I pulled her aside and said, \"Taught you well, young padawan.\"  She didn't get it.  I'm like dude, we're not actually allergic to sugar we just say that to people who try to force us to eat the shit, right?  I did it when you were younger, and now you're carrying the torch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer jaw dropped.  She was not faking it, she honestly thought they were allergic.  She yelled at me, then yelled at her brother to yell at me too.  Son didn't care, he laughed.  But Belle was pissed.  She called me a liar and other bad names.  She asked me if they were even allergic to milk.  I said, \"You tell me.  You drank 2 glasses of egg nog at thanksgiving then shit yourself?\"  Its been a week and she's insisting her entire life has been a lie.  Again, my Son doesn't care.  Both of my kids are incredibly healthy.  This wasn't a lie I perpetuated throughout their lives...I honestly forgot about it.

I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. \n\nI opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.\n\nShe reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that \"I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had.\" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.\n\nSince her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. \n\nNow that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to \"force myself\" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. \n\nBut I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. \n\nWhen she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her. I missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on our favorite shows.

I have fairly traditional values regarding relationships and a very broad definition of what I consider to be cheating or inappropriate behavior. Included in there is exposing ourselves to other people (obviously aside from medical shit or locker rooms) and especially without talking about it beforehand first, this was a dealbreaker we both agreed on. She has always known and seemingly shared my boundaries and we've never had any issues.\n\nAs a \"belated\" Christmas present, she presented me with an envelope of about a dozen photos.

She then informs me that she didn't have them taken on her own, she went to a photographer.\n\nI'm absolutely livid. In my opinion, if someone told me \"I love my car, but I don't ever want you to do anything to it, if you do I'd be very upset\" and I went and customized their car anyway then called it a gift, they'd still have every right to be upset because slapping the label of \"gift\" on something doesn't diminish the fact you still did something you knew they'd be upset about.

Like her and several coworkers having what sounds like a really intense argument over technical stuff.\n\nI'll ask her what that was about, and she'll be like \"it's all good, just a meeting with Joe and Tim.\" And I'll be surprised because she's always talked about Joe and Tim as good friends.\n\nJust last Friday, I heard just her end of the conversation, but she was really tearing into someone saying that something wasn't going to work, and she wasn't about to waste her time trying to cobble something together based on a poor design. She  sounded super dismissive.\n\nI asked later what that was about, and she said \"Just my weekly meeting with my boss, were figuring out how to implement the (thing)\" \n\nI said that I would never talk to a boss like that, and I was kind of worried about the state of her job if she kept on like that. \n\nShe said that it's all good, her boss hired her because of her practical experience in a certain thing that a lot of people only know academically, and he'd rather have an honest reality check when something's not gonna work.\n\nI kinda find that hard to wrap my head around, even if that's the case that was such a confrontational way to put it.\n\nAnd day-in day-out it's like this. A couple hours of silence as she works, then an explosion of noise from a conference call. And repeat. It's honestly stressful to hear raised voices, seeming anger over technical stuff that I don't really have the context for so I just get the tone of voice, etc.\n\nI've talked to her about this, and she said that's just how people talk when they get really passionate about something they're doing. They're not really angry, just opinionated. And she's legit on good terms with her coworkers, she just got a great raise at her last performance review, there are no problems.\n\nI told her that still, I don't like it, I don't like living in a house with someone who has these kinds of arguments day in and day out that I have to hear. And that I regretted moving in together, I hadn't known this side of her when I moved her in.\n\nShe got really upset about that and said that it's always been there. And there's nothing bad about actually giving a damn about your work.\n\nAITA for what I said, and how frustrated I am with my girlfriend, who's work involves a lot of heated arguments?

He impregnated his mistress, and eventually got married. Our relationship has been rocky ever since.\n\nMy dad seems to be the primary taker of his child (now 4 y/o) due to her mother working long hours nearly everyday. Although I have a rocky relationship with my dad, I still spend time with my younger half sister and treat her no different as any of my other siblings. Recently, my dad reached out to me in need of help to watch younger half sister while he goes on vacation for 3 weeks. Unfortunately, the time he's leaving falls around the time of my busiest school quarter, and then Spring break- which puts me in a situation where I'd have to sacrifice pretty much all of my spare time to watch half sister. I usually wouldn't mind, however, my dad has failed to ask half sisters mom to sacrifice any of her time in order to take care of her own child. She refuses to take time off work, or even work fewer hours, and insists I take their child for nearly 13 hours each day in order for her to get sleep and feel energized for work. I feel this is completely unfair to not only me, but their child as well, who is put at the butt of both their priorities. I told both dad and half sister's mom I would only be available 4 times out of the week to baby sit (which is nearly everyday) and received hateful comments about my inability to reciprocate any kind of help my dad has given me throughout the years. Although I feel bad about not being more of help to both of them, I can't help but feel like I deserve to put aside some time for myself in between working and going to school full time, instead of sacrificing nearly every second of free time to watch my half sister while her dad goes on vacation and her mom spends all her time working.

Given this statament, \"AiTA for asking for repayment after supporting everyone for 5 months? | \n\n  In September my partner was in an accident. A week later he came home and absolutely demanded I sell my car. He was extremely clear that it was to be sold. My car was definitely running but not in the best shape of its life. But I was still driving it. And I had been going back and forth about weather I wanted to sell or fix. I was currently on wanting to fix, even going as far as asking him how hard it would be to fix ourselves, watching a few videos about it, and looking at prices for parts. He was aware of my feelings, I involved him totally.\n\n  Well exactly one day after selling my beloved car he comes home and tells me hes not able to work anymore as hes in too much pain. I wasnt aware he was in that much pain as he made no effort to get looked at prior to this convo. Hes said hes been in similar pain for years and made no effort to get checked out before all this despite having excellent health coverage. He only says hes in more pain. I found it odd that it was so conveniently after I've just received quite a bit of money for my car. But I did not mention my feeling about that at the time, but I have now. But he promised that I could just get another car. \n\n  But as time went on and I tried to actually get another car, he shot down every car I suggested. Right from a decent used car from a dealership to craigslist and facebook jalopies. All this is happening while I'm slowly depleting the money I have for another car by supporting our household because I dont make enough to support everyone on my paycheck alone. Before this all happened the expenses were split pretty 50/50. Hes always known that I couldnt support us all by myself. So in theory it'd have been very bad for him to be out of work. Had I not sold my car.\n\n  Now that he's ready to rejoin the workforce and received his lost wages for the last 5 months, we've been talking about all the late bills we'll need to catch up on. And another car. Because now he needs the car we do have. While I'm left out in the literal cold to bum rides home from work and uber, which is further depleting my savings. \n\n  So when I asked if we'd be getting me another car, he blew up. He was even calling me mean names. After awhile I couldnt take the mindfuck anymore and started calling him names back, I do admit. He said I'm being greedy for asking and I should just save up on my own if I want another car. How I was the one that had wanted to sell my car.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not wanting to let my mom stay the night? | Brief backstory here, I\u2019m 23 and live with my boyfriend. We live in a small one bedroom apartment.\n\nMy mom relocated to live near me after I moved 1500 miles away from my problematic family at 18. I thought it could be a clean start and she might have changed in that time, but it is evident her narcissism, possible addiction, and mental illness still persist. \nBecause of all of that, she has terrible credit and cannot rent an apartment of her own so she rents rooms from other people. Since moving here in August, she\u2019s had 3 different living situations. We are always forced to take work off and help her move since she has no family here. \n\nIn the beginning of March I let her stay on our couch for 4 days waiting for her finances to get in order to move into a new place. Then, within 10 days of moving in, she says that the guy she roommates with had to \u201crefinish the bathtub\u201d so she would have to stay the night with us.\n\nI was skeptical because I didn\u2019t understand why refinishing the tub would render an entire bathroom unusable for a 24 hour period. I asked her about this and she then said \u201cwell we have some kind of bug, I don\u2019t know what it is, I wake up with bites so maybe he is bug bombing the house\u201d \n\nThis made me very concerned as we obviously don\u2019t want to have bed bugs or fleas or any kind of bug in our house. It seems like she purposely tried to make it seem like the bathroom was the issue to not make the bug thing apparent before I agreed to let her stay.\nI told her we didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her staying here and would consider getting her a hotel room. She was upset that I would \u201cthink she has bugs\u201d and I said she could stay as long as she only brought the bare essentials in a plastic sealed bag. (We are poor so could not afford to put her in a hotel anyway.)\n\nToday, we were getting ready for work and offered to give her a ride back home. She was still asleep on the couch at 1:30pm. She said she would just find someplace else to go for the day and left abruptly, clearly miffed by me saying that it was time to go.\n\nI really want to have a talk with her and explain that our couch is not a place for her to stay. We are adults with our own lives and I don\u2019t feel responsible for taking care of her. In March alone she has been on our couch for five days total. \n\nI moved away from my family to NOT deal with this pervasive instability and now it has followed me.\n\nTLDR, am I the asshole for not wanting my mom staying at our house (and possibly infect us with bed bugs?)\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter? | My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.\n\nMy wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.\n\nSo I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.\n\nWell, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.\n\nAITA for not wanting to change the dog's name?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for denying my best friend a luxury hotel getaway because of my abortion? | My partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. (Condom broke, we used the morning after pill but I still ended up conceiving)\n\nAfter consulting with my family, doctors and my partner, we decided for an abortion. Due to a recent health condition of mine that put me at risk, this was a choice made in regards to my physical and mental health. Neither of us were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of us. \n\nFortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of my entire life, my family, partner and close friends were very supportive. \n\nSeeing as I was only 8 weeks pregnant, we opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, my partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic. (My home was over an hour away)\n\nI was touched by his thoughtfulness and told my best friend, who hates my partner, by the way.  She wanted to join me in the hotel instead of him, to \u2018support\u2019 me. \n\nShe went on to say that my partner should pay for a full spa treatment for the both of us. This comment caught me off-guard. \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to the hotel for a fun, fancy weekend, but to be close to the clinic and have a comfortable and clean environment. Aside from that, my partner intended to be there for me and I *wanted* him there. \n\nThis made her upset. She said that I chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic. I should always chose my best friend over any man, she added. [Side Note: She was supportive 60% of the time, which I\u2019m thankful for. But she also made remarks that it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, my fear was unjustified and only in my head, it wouldn\u2019t hurt anyways, etc.]\n\nIt escalated a little, but ultimately the abortion took place and I went there with my partner, not her. No spa treatments, by the way, just the most painful experience of my life.\n\nAfterwards, she kept bringing up that she should have been there instead of my partner. \n\n**AITA for choosing my partner over my best friend in this situation and denying her a luxury weekend? I\u2019ll admit that we were both going through a lot of stress at our workplace, so I do understand that she wanted a spa getaway. I feel like I made the right call, but it was recently brought up and she still feels like this was selfish - so I\u2019m unsure and would appreciate a strangers POV.**\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not wanting to fix my relationship with my stepfather? | I never knew my father. My mom met my stepdad when I was 6, and they had my (half) brother when I was 7. He was pretty much the only father figure in my life, and gladly called me his daughter. We were never really close but the love was there.\n\nMy mom left for the first time 4 years ago. At that time I was working for my stepdad so we spent a lot of time together. He needed a shoulder to cry on. I listened to him saying horrible things about my mother and sharing intimate details. I tried to defend her when he was going too far but I mainly just listened. It put me in a very delicate situation, but I was the only person he could talk to. He also wanted to adopt me, but we didn't go through with it. A few months later the situation calmed down and my mom moved back in.\n\n2 years ago my mom left for good. My stepdad called me many times, again insulting my mom and sharing way too many details. Once again I tried to make him see her side while providing emotional support. Then we progressively lost touch. In the meantime my mom wrote to me regularly on messenger telling me how my stepfather was harassing her, insulting her and so on. I repeatedly told her to either go to the police or tell her lawyer about it. It didn't mean I didn't love my stepdad, but he messed up and I was hoping that a reminder of the law would set him straight. \n\nIn January my mom realised he'd had access to her Facebook for a year and a half. I felt terrible. I realised the reason he avoided me was because he'd read the PMs about him. I understood he'd be upset, but hoped he'd understand that I was thrown in the middle of a messy divorce and just tried to support both my parents when they needed it.\n\nOver the course of the year his relationship with my mother got better. Then this summer I had to get some stuff from the family house but I had a really bad gut feeling and couldn't bring myself to ask my stepdad if I could come over. My mom texted him for me. He answered by calling me a hypocrite and a b\\*tch, and said he didn't want anything to do with me. He cut me completely out of his life.\n\nMy family wants us to make up. But I can't do that knowing he chose to keep his little power trip going instead of confronting me when he first read the PMs. I believe this situation could've been avoided if he had told me he read everything and if we had talked about how I truly cared for him but he went too far. Now it's too late. He chose access to my mom's PMs over me. \n\nNow, it was my 21st birthday a couple days ago. Unsurprisingly, no message from him. Yesterday my mom tells me she confronted him again about abandoning me and he said laughing that he didn't and that I just had to contact him. I feel like an AH for refusing to do so.\n\nI'm really hurt and I wish I could have a (step)dad again. But at the same time, I can't trust him after he cut me out so easily.

Given this statament, \"AITA For disowning my cousin (who's also my wife's best friend) |   \n\nMy cousin decided to marry her boyfriend of 2 years (they were both 21 at the time.) I became good friends with him and continue to be today. He was deployed overseas after being married for almost a year (Army.) Fast-forward nearly another year. He returns from overseas to discover she wants a divorce and on top of that had been cheating on him while he was deployed. They get divorced and she moves in with her parents. A mere few months later she is pregnant by the guy she cheated with. He immediately ditches her and the baby, leaving her to raise it alone.\n\nMy cousin and I are very different despite being close as kids. We didn't hang out much but I harbored no ill will until she cheated on her spouse who is a close friend to me. I was upset but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. \"People make mistakes\" I thought.\n\nFast-forward 18 months. Cousin gives birth to the baby and is living with my grandparents. They are getting on in years and they noticed their memories are not what they used to be (History of Alzheimer's in the family.) They decide to talk to their lawyer to check their affairs are in order because they are unsure how many years of being sound of mind they have left (Keep in mind right now they are still fine.)\n\nCousin takes grandparents to lawyer\u2019s office. Cousin gets in her head (don't ask because I don't have an answer) that they are going to sign over to her sole power of attorney and management of their finances in preparation of them being unable to make such decisions in the future. The lawyer immediately shoots it down stating the following:\n\n\"That is premature as well as a poor choice of guardianship as the grandparents have two perfectly capable sons in their early 50's.\"\n\nGiving a 20-something single mom with no job and hardly any work experience that responsibility and power is a bad move.\n\nShe gets up on his desk screaming at him he has no right,etc. Lawyer asks her to cease at once or he will call the police. She doesn't. He gets on the phone to dial 911. She explodes out of the room and speeds off, leaving my grandparents stranded. The lawyer apologizes and pays for my grandparents to get a ride home.\n\nCousin is also best friends with my wife. They would hang out all the time and my wife really enjoys spending time with her little one. For me though, it was the last straw. My grandparents are the sweetest old folks you'd ever meet and she tried to take advantage of them before making a scene like that. I explained to my wife that I understand they are friends but I FORBID cousin to step foot in MY house. \n\nSince that day I have had no interest in seeing cousin. Wife still sees her now and again but less than before because she knows I've disowned cousin. I understand cousin is still family and was hopefully doing what she did for her child in the end but I don't think that is enough for me to stomach associating with her after that last incident.

Given this statament, \"AITA for buying dice? | So I thought I was fine, but I got bombarded with a few comments saying I was taking advantage of somebody for buying dice off of them so I figured I'd come here because now I'm unsure.\n\nTo start, I'm a bit of a dice collector. Some of these sets have been discontinued for ages and are impossible to find, and are largely dependent on somebody being willing to give them up, which is almost never. I came across a rare set tonight.\n\nSo tonight I was at my local game store for FNM. A 17 year old guy came in and had a block of dice that usually gets used for counters in M:tG. When I was paired up against him I noticed that they were actually a very rare set of dice that have been discontinued for 16 years now and are very valuable. I asked to see them and as soon as I looked I knew exactly what they were. I started telling him about the dice, how they're rare and valuable to collectors, why they're so special and their history, and how much they're roughly worth, as I didn't remember the exact going price. He seemed surprised but excited that he had something so special. I then asked if he'd possibly be willing to sell me some of them, and he agreed. I wanted to check what the going price for them was because I wanted to be fair; he may not value them the way that I do, but I don't want to take advantage of somebody just because they're not a collector since that\u2019s not cool.\n\nI couldn't find any older ebay searches, so I consulted an FB group I'm in to ask the going rate and specified I was trying to buy from a non-collector and wanted to give him a fair deal. I ended up getting the rough going rate and we agreed on a price, and I bought 9 of these dice from him for $180. That might sound like a lot for these dice but boy howdy welcome to collecting, one of the most valuable polyhedral sets goes for close to $1k now due to demand. We're big sweaty nerds, I get it.\n\nHe has 3/4 of the block left so if he ever wanted to collect as well, he has more than enough to work with in the future, and the knowledge I gave him so nobody tries to take advantage of him in the future. He seemed excited to be able to buy some cards he wanted with the money I gave him, and excited that he also found out he has something so special.\n\nHowever, on my FB post, I got a few comments saying it was taking advantage to even try to buy them from him in the first place, and I was an asshole for doing it even if I paid him what I'd pay an informed collector, and because I'm older than him (I'm 25). I felt because I was older and more informed that being clear with him and paying him fairly would be enough, but now I'm not sure if the dynamics here were poor and I was an asshole about this. I'm super anxious and I've got bad shakes thinking that maybe I hurt somebody with this even if they seemed happy with the deal, so I guess I wanted to know for sure from this sub.\n\nAITA for buying these dice?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

The class is MWF but last Monday was a holiday so the first day of class was last Wednesday.  I attended the first day of class but it was packed so I had to stand in the back.  Then I missed the Friday lecture as well as the Monday lecture.  Today, Wednesday, was my 1st day back. I knew the class was packed so I came 10 min early to get a seat in the front row.  I prefer to sit in the front row because I have anxiety.  By sitting in the front I'm able to ask questions/answer questions without being forced to shout it across the room.  I'm perfectly capable of doing well in a course if I'm forced to sit in the back...this is just a strong preference.\n\nAll seats are first come, first served.  There are 2 seats in each class called \"priority seats\" specifically designated for the disabled that are only open to abled students when they're unoccupied.  You have to notify the school, then the professor makes sure that seat is available to you every lecture. For the abled seats, after a few weeks people always tend to sit in the same seats and you get the impression that its your \"seat\" that you sit in for the rest of the semester even though its technically not.  After I sit down I notice 2 girls walk in together talking and laughing.  One girl sits in the seat behind me and the other girl stands next to me and says:\n\nGirl 1: Hi, sorry, actually you're sitting in my seat.\n\nMe: There is no assigned seating.  Anyone can sit anywhere.\n\nGirl 1: Yeah but I've been sitting in this seat all semester (this is our 3rd lecture out of like 30). There are still open seats in the back that you can move to.\n\nMe: Which means there are also open seats in the back that you can sit in too, right?\n\nGirl 1: Look...I'm deaf in 1 ear. I need a seat in the front row.  Move please. (I saw her hearing aid)\n\nMe: Then you'd be registered with the disabled students department and they would have made sure you had priority seating. This isn't a priority seat.\n\nGirl 1: I don't need to register anything with the school and I dont need to explain myself to you.  Its my seat...I told you I need it because I'm hard of hearing.\n\nMe: Wouldn't those same rules apply to me as well? Not needing to explain myself to you?\n\nGirl 2: Stop being an asshole and just fucking move...jesus.\n\nMe: I'm done talking. I'm not moving.\n\nGirl 1 and Girl 2: \\*\\*scoffs\\*\\*\n\nGirl 1: \\*\\*finds another seat\\*\\*\n\nI don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I damn sure spent the rest of class overhearing everyone behind me talking shit about me. It's important to point out that we're always given worksheets that we can work on with the person behind us...so its possible Girl 1 mostly wanted my seat so she could work with Girl 2 on it.

I thought it was a good idea and mentioned how much money he'd be saving. When I said, \"we\", he just kind of laughed it off.\n\nSince then, I have driven all the time with one exception. When I found out I was selected for promotion, he insisted we go out and I could pick the place. I was just planning a chill night in as it was Tuesday, but he talked me down. When we got to the parking lot, he said, because I chose the place, I should drive, which sounded fair. Next week, we go to a place of his choosing, and I end up driving because he \"left his keys.\" I brought up the trend a week later saying it was causing me not to want to go out with him. He said that because he drives a truck, a 50/50 split isn't beneficial for him but agreed to a driving one out of every three times. I agreed but stated that because I've already given him numerous rides (we went out to lunch numerous times at work where always was the one driving), that we should do 50/50 for October. He agrees.\n\nYesterday, I stopped avoiding him and we were leaving around the same time and he recommends a carpool. I say yes, again expecting him to drive but I again end up driving. Last night, we were both planning to go to this new bar with a buddy and he suggests a carpool again. I put my foot down and tell him, only if he's driving. He insists on me driving because he doesn't know the place but I say neither do I. He says my car will blend in more and nobody will mess with as opposed to his truck. After no budging on my side, he suggests an Uber, which I decline. I say I'm just driving and he says he'll tag along. I tell him firmly, that if I'm driving, he will not be in my car. He says he'll but me a beer, but I'm firm on the principle of the matter. Plus it's literally one dollar beer night. I stop talking to him and he assumes that means it's settle an tried to tag along an hour later as I'm leaving.\n\nI stick to my guns, and end up leaving without but we have an argument about how with the beer I'd come up even on gas and if I'm going anyway, I should take him. I'm bring up all the other times I've given him rides and him if he sees my side and my point. He blatantly denies seeing my point I go to leave. Before I go, I try one last time, even saying I'll give him a ride if he can see my side and why I want him to drive. He says no again and I leave. Now he won't speak to me. AITA?

But, a few months after my daughter's birth, my mom (61f) texts me and says she is moving to the Philippines to adopt a baby. Reasoning: She's always wanted to adopt a baby. This is true.

He\u2019s apparently one of those weird people who is touchy with a lot of girls. My girlfriend told me he had touched her a lot more than usual and had even breathed down her neck despite her telling him to stop. She told me that he always does it in such a jokey way that when she tells him to stop he never takes it seriously, although it makes her so uncomfortable it brought her to tears. \n\nThere were incidents before this, apparently her ex also had a massive problem with her colleague. She\u2019s told me that he also honks his horn at 14 year old girls and is a massive creep.\n\nWe discussed it and came to the conclusion that next time she saw him she should take him to one side and really tell him how uncomfortable he makes her. She has evidence of him drinking at work so could easily get him fired, thereby using that as ammunition she could get him to take her seriously. I obviously wanted her to get him fired right away but she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt which is fair enough. \n\nShe had work with the same guy again today but didn\u2019t say anything because she doesn\u2019t want to \u2018make a fuss\u2019 or \u2018cause drama\u2019.  I am quite pissed off and disappointed with her because she\u2019s just throwing away her self respect and letting people get away with treating her like shit.

And we all live in the same house but I don\u2019t think I can be part of her life anymore. She\u2019s probably one of the most manipulative people I\u2019ve ever met and has consistently made me feel horrible my whole life even though I\u2019ve done significantly more for her than she has for me. She has a daughter who I love a lot. And I basically helped raise her since I was 11. But I can\u2019t be a \u201cmom\u201d anymore. My older sister just expects me to take care of her daughter and do every little thing for her. She\u2019s taken advantage of me for so long. And I let her. She\u2019s put me down a lot. For not wearing makeup. For being ten pounds heavier than she is. For not doing enough for her. For not making her food when she wants. For never being enough. For having feelings. But today she drew the line after getting in an argument with me and at one point I called her a bitch. She sent me oodles of essays via text. I apologized for calling her that and for what happened during the fight but then she continued to put me down and blame me for her problems. She kept telling me I wasn\u2019t really \u201csorry.\u201d I realize I could\u2019ve been better during the argument but she insisted she was the only one who was calm.

However, being busy professionals, we deal with it.\n\nGF got a new job in the spring as a project manager for a shipping association. She's been putting together industry events, organizing tours for various ships, etc. These events almost always occur away from our home city. Some of them are quite far away (travel by plane), but others have been in driving distance (around an hour).\n\nOn the occasion that the event has been closer, I've asked if she could consider staying at home or if I could drive up and stay with her. She's always refused. Her reasoning is that she's going to be way too busy with work, and will just be crashing at the hotel (or place she's staying).\n\nRecently, an event she was organising came up in our city. Two weeks before it, she let me know that she would be staying at the event site. I asked her why, as the city transit goes there, and all together we're talking maybe 30-35 minutes door to door. I got the usual response. I asked if I could come and stay with her, she said no. I dug further and asked about the plans in the evening. The first night she says she'll be working late setting up, but then her portion will finish, so she doesnt need to worry about tear down. I ask her why is she staying there for an additional two nights, then? It comes out there are social events those nights. Events I'm not invited to. I say fine, doesn't feel great, but then can she please just come back home after the parties rather than stay at the site? She says no, she has to be back at the event in the mornings.\n\nI got upset.\n\nI pointed out it takes longer for me to get to work from her apartment than it would for her to get to the event, and yet I do this all the time. I pointed out that none of this is a reason I couldn't come stay with her. I pointed out she could just leave the social portion before it was 2AM and get a good night's sleep if she wanted. I pointed out we dont spend that much time together as is. I pointed out I am NEVER (not an exaggeration) invited to anything to do with her new job, when I am very conscientious to invite her to everything in the hopes she'll make it.\n\nHer response was to question why I can't just support her, and that this is what she feels she needs to be successful. I told her I would like to support her but these decisions seem less about work and more about socializing and convenience and they don't make me feel valued in the relationship.

After that my our relationship turned into shit. We would constantly argue about it and they would argue that I would end up in the streets doing heroin or crack. I would tell them there is no way that is happening because I had no interest in doing them. Those arguments would always end up with them calling me a drug addict and when I would get mad and start shouting at them they would tell me that I am high and that it is making me overreact and emotionally impulsive. After a while they started getting so paranoid that they wouldn't even let me stay over at my friends' houses over the night (and it was not that common either) because they were stoners and they would start texting me at 3 am to come back and ask me whats my friends address to find me whenever I would say no. If I showed up high at my house they would start harassing me and I would shout at them for it and that would only confirm their beliefs that being high made me unreasonable and angry (it didn't). One time after we argued that they should let me go to my friend's house over the night because they let my sister got to her friend's house they said no because I have ruined their trust. So I sneaked out and once they found out they went to the police department after insulting me and made me talk to the police officer over the phone. They would rationalize their controlling behavior by saying that they want to protect me but I found them extremely disrespectful since they were not even protecting me from anything, their views on marijuana were based on the stereotype that all stoners are losers.\n\nEventually, I got so sick of it and whenever my parents would come tired and stressed from work I would argue with them not because I wanted to change their minds, but in order to apply more pressure to them and make them have a mental breakdown out of spite. I eventually stopped smoking weed because I didn't like it that much, I even threw my dab pen in the trash to prove to them that I was not addicted. They knew I smoked once in a while but they stopped harassing me since I had a 4.0 GPA in my first semester in college. It was too late by then, I had no respect for them and I would ignore most of their calls and texts for the entire semester out of spite which really hurt them but I had no remorse for them. I knew my parents loved me but had no respect for me, in their eyes I was just a depraved drug addict, and respect is the foundation of any relationship, love means nothing to me I am not being respected by someone, and so I would ignore them because I knew I could not change their mind but still wanted to punish them for it and force them to respect me by threatening to cut them off entirely when I was away for the semester.

She's still quite fearful, but getting better every day. Because she used to be a stray, her teeth, digestive system and coat were in a poor shape. We managed to make it better through hard work and a light diet. Our vet told us that as a stray she probably ate a lot of trash and scraps of salty human meals, so we should be even more careful with feeding her processed human foods than usual. If we want to treat her, we boil some (safe) vegetables, give her a few slices of an apple or a spoonful of sugar-free yoghurt, but spicy and salty processed sausages or ham are off limits.

I like to study there because its quite, however recently, I found a semi-hidden room. It had a bunch of couches, bookshelves, desks and a chair. Basically, it looked like a standard student lounge, so I elected to study there because its less creepy than the basement. There were a few signs saying \"Quiet please, this lounge is being transformed into an area for prayer, meditation and relaxation\", but seeing as how I was literally the only one there and I was just quietly studying, I thought I would be fine. After an hour, a guy came in with a prayer mat and started praying. I was as quiet as possible, and didn't acknowledge it but I feel like it made him uncomfortable as he kinda peeked in the room and walked out before hand. I thought it would be worse if I straight up bailed as soon as he started praying, so I kinda just chilled there and continued to review my flashcards. I wasn't in front of him or anything either. But I still feel like kind of a dick for encroaching in his prayer, especially since specific prayer rooms dont exist in our uni. This is also the second time this has happened to me, and one of my friends called me a slight asshole the first time for not leaving when someone came in to pray. (This was a diffrent senario though. The first time was when I was having a slight mental break down and ran off to one of the more hidden rooms in my uni building, and some guy started praying while I was low-key crying. I still dont think I was in the wrong that time, as this was not a designated area and I was there first.

Seven years ago the administration and I decided to hire a new teacher, Amanda (name changed). Amanda had great credentials, had degrees in both math and chemistry, and as we soon found out was an excellent teacher.\n\nTwo months ago I found out she is not who she says she is. I'm part of a Facebook group to help people locally with things for free. You post something you have you don't want anymore, someone else comments they want it, you meet up and give it to them. I've been a part of this group for a few months now and I found Amanda, but under a different name. I have Amanda on Facebook, and this other account used the same photos, just a different name. My best guess is Amanda had a profile connected to her teaching life, and one being her real account.\n\nIt took me a couple of days to message her and ask her what's going on. She was straightforward with me: her friend is Amanda who had all the credentials and education, and she let \"Amanda\" apply to jobs using them. \"Amanda\" went to school, too, but not as prestigious a school, and did not graduate. The real Amanda works for some company in another city. So she colluded with her friend to apply for teaching jobs using Amanda's CV and then \"Amanda\" shows up and does the job.\n\n\"Amanda\" is a great teacher. The kids love her and she does her job well. She's also a great person. You don't *need* to be accredited to teach in a private school here. You could hire someone straight out of highschool, it's all based on ability/merit. I told \"Amanda\" I'd have to think about it and I think now my decision is to take inaction.\n\nI don't dare tell anyone else, even ask their opinions, because this would put her job at risk. Not only that, but get police involved for fraud/identity theft. That last part has me conflicted because what she has done is unethical and illegal. She gained her position on false pretenses. I wonder to myself at night if I'm wrong for doing nothing and allowing it to happen: someone more deserving and capable could be working this job, I'm putting my neck on the line for admittedly a friend now.\n\nI'd love some outsider thoughts on whether I'm the asshole here.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

They shut the dog in a room of their house which makes her bark more than usual.\n\nShortly after they approached me when my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t home, they offered me their dog on a timeshare.

At the end of the road is a small local parish church. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm training intervals I usually jog the 1km to the road to warm up, stop and do some dynamic stretching, and then start my intervals (normally 400 or 800m long). In-between intervals I have short recovery sessions, where I'll sometimes jog slowly, walk, or stretch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other day I was doing some stretching between reps on the bench at the end of the road, which is opposite the church. The weather recently has been fairly warm, but very grey and wet, so I was wearing a lightweight long-sleeve top to keep the worst of the rain off, and spandex running shorts (something like [this](https://www.nike.com/gb/t/fast-running-shorts-2c26G6)) because I figured I would be too hot in leggings. An older woman came up to me and told me that I was being very disrespectful for lingering and stretching in such small shorts outside a church, especially as there were also a lot of primary schools in the area. I apologised and moved onto another street to finish my intervals and stretching, but it wasn't really an ideal place to do speed sets because it's a lot busier and I often end up having to stop for cars during the intervals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo was I being disrespectful? I wasn't raised Christian and I don't want to upset people who are if what I was doing really was offensive. I would never do it on a Sunday morning when people are going into/coming out of a service, but this was around 3pm on a Monday afternoon and it seemed to be closed. Also as a Jew, I would feel perfectly comfortable doing the same outside a synagogue as long as it wasn't on a Saturday morning/holiday. I also wasn't deliberately trying to appear provocative at all, I was just doing some calf stretches ([like this](https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/322/322809/calf-wall-stretch.jpg)) because my calf/achilles were giving me a bit of bother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I'm the asshole I'll try and find another place for the summer, because it's going to be too hot to wear leggings most of the time.

Given this statament, \"AITA for hiding the fact that I switched careers from my parents? | To give some context, I\u2019m a senior in college and was pre-med/neuroscience up until last year. I tried applying to med schools last cycle and didn\u2019t get in. I decided to add a fifth year to add a psychology major in order to boost my gpa and apply again. I fell in love with psychology and decided to apply to a grad program in psych. It\u2019s truly my passion and what makes me happy. I debated telling my parents but I decided against it because I have a mother that criticizes everything and makes me feel bad about everything I do. She\u2019s never been nice about anything good I\u2019ve done and I always end up feeling stupid after telling her about it. To counteract this, I hide all of my accomplishments from my parents so that I don\u2019t feel bad about them. \n\nI wanted to avoid getting my feelings hurt because I even heard back from the program. I\u2019m extremely sensitive and I know if she tried hard enough she could make me hate the program that I was super excited about applying to. Because of this, I couldn\u2019t tell my father either out of fear that he would convince me to tell her or tell her himself.\n\nA few days ago I found out that I got in and I was so happy! This is a passion of mine and I feel so content and comfortable. I decided to tell my parents that night and the first thing my mom said was that she would never be happy with it and neither would my father. She then proceeded to make fun the grad program and told me it was nothing to be excited about. Then she told me that I only switched because I didn\u2019t think I would be able to make it through med school. My dad was quiet through all of this. Like I said earlier, I\u2019m extremely sensitive and this completely crushed me. I started crying and then she called me names for crying and said that I was being overly dramatic. I went to my room and stayed there heartbroken and in tears for the rest of the night. My dad came to me and told me that I should have told them earlier and he would have supported me. But the issue was never him supporting me, it was that I always knew he wouldn\u2019t defend me to my mom. I told him that I didn\u2019t want to be discouraged before I even got in and he told me that it wouldn\u2019t have happened (even though I knew it would...and it did). He really guilted me for not telling them but I was just protecting my heart and self-esteem. My mom has been going off about it for days and is standing firm in the belief that she wasn\u2019t wrong for the things she said and that it was just parental concerns. I told her that it felt more like bullying than her having genuine concerns which led to her going on another tirade. My dad was still silent through all of this.\n\nAnd to add, my parents aren\u2019t paying for my school. It\u2019s covered by financial aid. But I do live at home and I\u2019m very dependent on them.

However, a few minutes later someone lined up behind us, the girl that ended up behind us had a very aggressive terrier. I am not at all bothered by dogs, well behaved or not... but I could tell Lacy was getting anxious and her hands were getting sweaty.

Our beds are about a metre apart from each other, so there's barely any personal space.\n\nThere's a little problem with one of my roommates (let's call her A). Multiple times she has invited her friends over without telling us, even though we have a groupchat. It's always sudden, and her friends leave extremely late (one time her friends decided to leave at 1:30 am on a Thursday).

Me and the other 19 year old roommate (let's call her S) leave in the morning, while A decides to sleep in. I return back to our room at about 3pm, A is still in bed and she tells me that she decided not to go to university today. Understandable. I leave the dorm again, go to library to study, and then return at about 7:30. S is already at the room. At 8pm there's knocking on our door, and one of A's friends (let's call her V) comes in. Alright, it's not that late, she can hang out here I guess, it would've been nice for A to let us know that she's inviting V over though. They talk, loudly. For some reason, sitting 30cm apart means that they have to yell at each other.

I\u2019ve had issues with him for a long time: classic immaturity, narcissism, likes to intentionally provoke me.\n\nTonight, he noticed the rubbish bin oveflowing onto the road. \n\nHe says, \u201cThere\u2019s rubbish all over the road because SOMEONE doesn\u2019t know how to put the rubbish in the bin properly\u201d. \n\nIt was my fault, but I\u2019m annoyed that he seriously can\u2019t come in and say, \u201cThere\u2019s rubbish on the road because you didn\u2019t put the rubbish in properly. Can you clean it up?\u201d \n\nI retort, and that\u2019s that. We move to another room with my sister, I\u2019m a little moody at this point. I knew he would keep prodding, as he usually does.\n\nHe spends the next 10 minutes giggling, \u201cWhy is it in a mood? What did I do? What\u2019s its problem?\u201d\nYes, he refers to me as \u201cit\u201d. This annoys me even more. He pokes and pokes. I don\u2019t respond. He leaves the room, my sister asks what\u2019s wrong. I tell her I\u2019m annoyed with how he acted. He comes back in, she tells him, he goes on to make more jokes about it. Giggling, he picks up his toddler son and says things like, \u201cYour aunty doesn\u2019t know how to put rubbish in the bin, does she?\u201d\n\nHe repeats this multiple times and can\u2019t seem to drop it. Sister is defending me at this point, telling him he\u2019s being a dick, needs to stop etc. At some point, he walks to the kitchen and drinks Coke straight out of the bottle (which he knows pisses me off). I retreat to my bedroom to nap (prompting a \u201cwhere\u2019s it going?\u201d from him). \n\nI\u2019m woken up by my sister who tells me that BIL bought me a pizza for dinner. This seriously fucking shits me. He can\u2019t bring up the bin situation maturely, and now he can\u2019t apologise for it either. He\u2019s not the type of guy who admits when he\u2019s wrong, so the pizza felt more like a twisting of the knife than an apology. \n\nI don\u2019t touch the pizza on account of me being stubborn. Sister tells me I should say thanks. I tell her I\u2019m not hungry. She tells me I should still say thanks and that I\u2019m being rude. I explain to her that I\u2019m still pissed, she tells me I need to take a joke and that I\u2019m being sensitive. It\u2019s funny how she was defending me at the time but has now done a complete 180. I\u2019m the bad guy now. \n\nAfter a few more back and forths, she tells me it\u2019s his way of apologising and that I should thank him. This just makes me angrier. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s suddenly enabling him again. What happened to actual, adult apologies? I know that he doesn\u2019t feel bad for his actions. I didn\u2019t want to accept this pizza, so I didn\u2019t say thank-you. I wanted an apology, not a pizza. I said to my sister, if he wants a thank-you he can come here and apologise first. \n\nTL;DR: My BIL provokes me, I\u2019m visibly upset. He buys me a pizza, I was still mad and refused to accept it. He never actually apologised, so I never thanked him for the pizza. I didn\u2019t eat it. \n\nThis caused a rift in the household tonight so I\u2019m curious: am I the asshole?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for accidentally taking a machine at the gym? | About two weeks ago I was at the gym and was training back. I arrived and went to do lat pull downs, low rows, and straight leg dead lifts (all 4 x 10 sets), so I\u2019ve been here for a solid 20 minutes already.\n\nI knew I needed the cable machine for my next exercise (straight arm pull downs) and needed a straight bar to do the exercise. I knew I needed to do these when I walked in but wanted to do the others first, and for the entire time I was doing the preceding 3 exercises there has been a cable free but with a water bottle and towel next to it. The reason why I didn\u2019t the cable earlier was because I was going to do another 2 exercises on them on top of the one I was planning on doing, and didn\u2019t want to lose the cable just in case. If I did them one after the other then I could stay on it as long as I needed.\n\nSo I head over to the cable that has the towel and bottle (again, haven\u2019t seen anyone use the cable for 20 or so minutes), and look around to catch anyone\u2019s eyes to let me know it\u2019s theirs. I wait for about 30secs to a minute and take off the rope attachment and attach the straight bar. A couple of guys ask me for the rope attachment and I give it to them, then I start doing my first set.\n\nAs soon as I finish the owner of the towel and bottle taps me on the shoulder and says \u201cYou do realise you just took my machine mate\u201d, and I immediately apologised and tried to get the rope he was using but couldn\u2019t find any left. I apologised again and explained I didn\u2019t see anyone here and he was visibly mad. \n\nI explained to him that I haven\u2019t seen anyone here using the cable for 20 mins, to which he explained he was on some other machine doing another set. He said \u201cYou should have asked around\u201d and \u201cA little gym etiquette goes a long way\u201d. He walked off pissed and did something else on another machine, didn\u2019t even want his machine back when I offered.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong here guys, I understand that I\u2019ve outright taken someones machine at the gym - not cool. But WIBTA if I asked around and 3 (for example) people said they haven\u2019t see anyone use the machine I want? WIBTA if I took his secondary machine that didn\u2019t have his towel and bottle? Would I have to ask around for THAT machine?\n\nAm I 100% in the wrong here? Where and how far does gym etiquette go for someone not occupying a machine for a noticeable amount of time? Also not sure if worth mentioning but this is my first gym etiquette/workout related incident, I try to be as civil as possible.\n\nMuch appreciated guys!\n\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Of course, it is theatre etiquette 101 not to talk while a show is happening, and I was pissed off since my friends were unable to watch my show because of uncorteous audience behavior. So I texted my mutual friend who talked for the entire show and told her that I was disappointed and kinda angry at her for talking through my show, informed her how sad I was that my friends were unable to watch my show due to her talking, and told her if she had no interest in seeing a show that she should simply not watch it instead of coming in and talking through the whole thing.

And the company will pay everything for continued education.\n\nShe does work she finds interesting (cutting edge robotics) and gets along well with her coworkers.

They want a type of fancy coffee, they get it.

I (25 Male) am a big car guy and as a result, both the vehicles I own are expensive performance cars ( '17 C63 AMG S and '18 Ghibli SQ4 for you car junkies out there) . As a result, I never let anyone who isn't directly under my insurance drive them ( Only my parents and GF ever drive them). In addition, I have around a total of 25k in modifications done to the cars, so I stand to lose that money in the unfortunate event that either car were to be damaged or totaled. Basically, they ended up coming for a short 2 week trip. They decided to use my house as a hub and travel around, which I didn't mind at all. When we discussed their plans for the 2 weeks, it became apparent that they would do a lot of long distance driving ( \\~2000 miles total) . I made sure they were aware that I would not be willing to let them use either car for their trip as they have had a history of not respecting other people's cars ( They filled regular gas in my dad's car before when it requires premium and brushed it off like it was no big deal). Things seemed fine and they booked a rental car, which I got them a huge discount on ( Worked out to an average of 32 bucks a day for a Small SUV) . They are not poor by any means btw, together making around 200k. The trip seemed fine, until after they returned home.

She decided to have her first drink ever and throughout the night she had more, though not a lot in my opinion (but I could be wrong considering her weight and other factors).\n\nShe\u2019s been acting kind of weird all night, but not really drunk, more just awkward. She\u2019d had about 4 shots and was seemingly sober when she came to me and said that she was acting weird because she could blame it on the alcohol and I didn\u2019t really mind the statement since she wasn\u2019t really whoring herself out for attention or anything, just being goofy.\n\nShe gets served a full glass of vodka but finished maybe a third and starts getting emotional. I laugh (mostly because I\u2019ve had some to drink and I knew she would be embarrassed the next day). She starts crying and just letting loose so much about her life. She\u2019s frustrated about a lot of things like her grandparents health and a crush she has. She was also stressed because she thought I was mad at her (I wasn\u2019t, just sick at texting and getting back to people if they don\u2019t really attempt to talk to me).\n\nIt gets to the point where we take her for a drive around town so she could get some fresh air and she begins to break down HEAVY. She\u2019s sobbing and venting about things but quickly starts talking about how much the people in the car mean to her. \n\nIt\u2019s just my other friend Lily and her boyfriend Rob, but she starts talking about how Lily is such a good friend to her and how Rob (who she\u2019d met for the first time an hour earlier) was one of her good friends and how she hoped he wanted to be her friend. The part where I got unnerved was she said nothing about me.\n\nI know that might sound selfish and conceited but I\u2019ve always agreed with \u201cdrunk words are sober thoughts\u201d and I guess it just made me think that my friendship with her didn\u2019t really matter that much to her. I was in the backseat with her and with her during the party, watching out for her and making sure she was fine. I was crying with her in the car when she was breaking down because I truly felt for her situation and I felt horribly, while Lily and Rob were laughing at her. I\u2019d been friends with her for 7 years now and I thought that I\u2019d have at least gotten a mention. I talked to her every day for month long periods and I just thought we were close.\n\nNow, about 3 weeks later, I haven\u2019t really tried to talk to her. I responded to her occasional texts bit I don\u2019t really try to keep the conversation going And they don\u2019t really come that often, maybe 2 or 3 times she\u2019s tried to text me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m TA or not in all honesty I just feel saddened if I\u2019m gonna be honest. \n\nAnyways, Reddit, AITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My dad died when I was 11, and I\u2019ve been getting survivor benefits since then. I was able to get my own bank account last April when I was 17, but I had to have my mom on the account as well, since I was underage. \n\nAfter I turned 18, my survivor benefits started getting directly deposited into my account, instead of my mother\u2019s. I didn\u2019t realize this until a month or two later because my mom was taking all of it out.\n\nWhen I asked her about it, she said that I was basically \u201cpaying rent\u201d and that my survivor benefits were being used to take care of me.\n\nHere\u2019s some more backstory \u2014 my mother doesn\u2019t give a shit about me.

I felt like I was a terrible fit for the position and I was severely depressed. On the other hand, I\u2019ve always enjoyed art, especially digital art, and I was tossing around the idea of going to art school. My parents were extremely non-supportive, telling me that I should stick to my chosen career path and that art school would be a poor choice. I talked to my sister about it, as well. She said that it was unrealistic, like my parents did. (Though, admittedly, she did tell me that I should do it if I really wanted to.) She suggested that I give my chosen career a choice for a little while longer, see how it felt, and then maybe try art school. I kept on trucking with my career and now I can say I\u2019m very, very happy with my decision.\n\nFast forward to now. My sister has been doing her chosen career path, non-health field-related, for a few years. Recently, she came up to me and told me that she\u2019s been feeling dissatisfied with her current position and wants to pursue her \u201cdream\u201d of going to medical school. She was talking about all her plans for getting ready for medical school, etc etc. I told her, just like the advice she gave me, that she should stick out her current position and that going to medical school was unrealistic with her age and her chosen field. I mean, after all, if I could stick out my current career, so can she. She got MAD, saying that she\u2019s always been supportive of what I wanted and dreamed of. Clearly not the case, even if the advice she gave was a good!\n\nOur parents are supportive of her plan, obviously because they think that medicine is more \u201cprestigious\u201d and \u201cworthwhile\u201d than art. My mother chastises me, saying that I should be more supportive of her, and I told her that I was being supportive, just as my sister has been supportive of me.

Given this statament, \"AITA for encouraging my BF to pursue his business idea? Now he's dead broke. | Roughly a year and a half ago my (24F) boyfriend Xavier (29M) expressed interest in quitting his full time job and starting up his own business. We have seperate finances and we plan to keep it that way. I have no stake in his financial success (or lack thereof). \n\nFrom the get go Xavier's family were not supportive of his business idea. They didn't believe his business could directly compete against 2 already established local businesses in the area and they strongly discouraged him from quitting his job. \n\nXavier was crushed by his family's reaction. He turned to me for support and (naively) I gave it to him. I strongly encouraged him to pursue his dreams. I told him he was clever,  hard working, dedicated and perserverent and he could achieve anything he set his mind to. I encouraged Xavier to live his life without regrets and rise up to the challenge. Basically a lot of motivational crap talk that in hindsight seems stupid now. \n\n At the time,  I genuinely believed Xavier had a decent chance of succeeding because he has a brilliant work ethic and a brilliant mind. However,  I knew there was also a good chance he would fail and lose money but I assumed Xavier knew the risks. \n\nFlash forward to today and Xavier's family were right - Xavier's business turned out to be a complete flop. There aren't enough clients for the business to be sustainable and he can't compete against the local competition. Xavier's in massive debt (he put all of his savings into the business and also took out a massive business loan) and he's been forced to close the business because he cannot keep it in operation without pouring more money into it. Now Xavier's currently looking for a full time job to replace the job he once had. He's also had to move back in with his parents because he can't afford rent or bills right now. \n\nAlthough the choice was ultimately Xavier's,  I am recieving all the blame from Xavier's family for steering him in the wrong direction. They believe he would have never quit his job if it wasn't for me. His Father believes I fed him false hope and pretty much ruined his life. His Mother sent me a ridiculously long  message saying  I was happy to let Xavier crash and burn because our finances are seperate and if I really loved him I would have looked out more for his financial security. \n\nXavier doesn't blame me at all and our relationship is still strong despite what his family thinks. \n\nWas I an asshole? At the end of the day it was Xavier's decision and I don't think I should feel guilty for encouraging him to pursue his dreams (even if those dreams don't work out).\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

We all live close so we throw gigantic family get togethers. All the time.\n\nMy grandparents own a pretty big ranch just outside of town. They\u2019re not rich by any means, but land is cheap out here and they\u2019ve owned the property for a long time. Because these gatherings sometimes attract upwards of 40 people, their ranch has been the venue of choice for as long as I can remember.\n\nMy uncles are all stereotypically masculine dudes, as are a lot of my older cousins, so our rendezvous generally revolve around sports, grilling, and gambling. Gambling isn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea, but I participate for the sake of being social. I usually lose a fair bit of money because I don\u2019t play cards or know sports teams as well as everybody else. It\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s become a reoccurring joke amongst family members.\n\nWell this time around we have an especially large gathering. So large that It\u2019s determined there\u2019s too many people to coordinate our typical gambling games. To make things simpler, my aunt comes up with an idea. She fills a jar full of beans and places it high up on the mantle. She tells us it\u2019s $20 a guess and whoever guesses closest to the number of beans inside gets to take home all the money. \n\nFor whatever reason this new form of betting got everyone in an especially adversarial spirit. Almost all of the adults participated and many even made multiple guesses to increase their odds. \n\nRemember how I\u2019m typically ignorant when it comes to gambling? Well this time I was in my element. I could tell the jar was a typical 64oz mason jar, which a quick Google search told me was 116 cubic inches in volume. I also found that a bean was about 0.15 cubic inches. Divide the jar by the beans and I got 773. Then I assumed 20% of it was air, which left me with ~619 beans. To be safe, I made two bets: one for 610 and the other for 630. \n\nAs I\u2019m making my bet, people are giving me crap like \u201cit\u2019d be easier if you just gave it directly to me\u201d and all the other usual ball busting, but I just smile and say nothing. Some can tell something\u2019s up and continue to give me grief for the rest of the night.\n\nAfter probably 40 minutes of interrupted counting, my aunt informed everyone that not only had I won, but both of my guesses were closer than anybody else\u2019s. \n\nAt first everybody was super happy for me, laughing about how lucky I am. One of the suspicious cousins from earlier asked how I did it, so I told everyone my strategy. Immediately I could see people\u2019s faces start to sour. One of my uncles said \u201cthat\u2019s bullshit\u201d and left the room. \n\nIt ended up being nearly $1100. My parents tell me that I should offer to return it because I didn\u2019t earn it fairly.

The group seems to not act as a support group even if that's what it is in theory, but rather a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths, how they can never understand emotions and never avoid from hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that \"remind her of me\" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description.

I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.\n\nWhenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles.

He still lives with his parents who have a pretty nice place and they\u2019re currently abroad so it seemed like a good opportunity to invite some friends over for some mindless drinking. We\u2019re not really all that close anymore- both about to graduate, we were tightest in the first few semesters, but still hang out fairly regularly. I guess you could say he\u2019s more of a chad/business kind of guy, while I enjoy more erudite pursuits.. \n\nAnyways, I mention this because this friend (some bitterness writing this now, after what happened) had just been on a serious workout-kick for a few months and he talked our ears off about his gains. We\u2019re the type of friends to pretty much openly poke fun at each other, so he was well roasted for his outspoken self-love..\n\nAnywhos, as the evening went on and everybody got drunker and drunker, I openly told him that I didn\u2019t think his biceps looked very impressive/defined. We\u2019d been in the pool and all still sat shirtlessly around the edge, imbibing the Goose. For some reason this remark (don\u2019t know how I worded it) shifted the dynamics of the situation. I guess he saw me as the kind of meek intellectual character of our group (think Sherlock or Yoda) and he appeared sincerely insulted.\n\nHe said something like \u201cThink you can take me on, champ?\u201d; I said I sincerely believed yes, but this conversation was stupid and not worth it so he should cool down now. Well, he said he never had fighting in mind, but no wonder I was pu\\*sying out already. I laughed it off, and when he called me spaghetti-boy most people thought it was lame. He didn\u2019t let it go though and proposed we should arm wrestle under the supervision of the others to settle the matter.\n\nNow, I\u2019m no chicken but I was really annoyed. I asked him why I should do this and insisted that I wouldn\u2019t do it without proper motivation. He looked around thinking, then, seeing his little pug Opal, who\u2019d sort of hung out with us during the course of the partying (running around). Opal was brushing up against me leg and he knew I adored the pupper, so he said: \u201cYou win, you get her.\u201d He was so fucking sure of himself to make this idiotic bet. The only reason I agreed was because it made me legitimately mad that he could be so arrogant to pawn off that his dog, even when drunk.\n\nWell, guess what. After a long back and forth and his shitty cockiness reaching a fever-pitch, I defeated him fair & square (three times). I took home the dog (who accepts me) and he completely FLIPPED OUT because I took him at his word. Opal is happy with me aside from some micturition issues and I don\u2019t think this \u201cfriend\u201d deserves his dog back, after proposing this demented bet.

He is qualified and can easily get a job but he chose not to. He was able to do this because a few years ago I was in a bad car wreck and received a decent amount of settlement money for my injuries. The whole time up until now, we have been paying the rent with my savings. Even now that he works he hasn\u2019t contributed to rent, the only thing he pays for is when we go out to eat. \n\nFor the past week, I have had extreme migraines & dizziness so I scheduled a doctors appt. I spent the night at my grandma\u2019s because the appt was much closer & I figured it would be easier to wake up here since I had been feeling bad & would have to drive less in the morning. \n\nCoincidentally, his mom & my grandma live in the same complex. After he got off of work, his plan was to go to his moms to sleep. We also agreed the night before that he would watch the baby while I went to my appt. \n\nHe gets out of work at 6 AM. I woke up at 10 AM, appt was at 11:30 AM. It took me a while to get out of bed because of the migraines & dizziness, & I also got up several times in the night to feed/change the baby. I figured by that time he was already asleep but I would call him to wake him up to let him know I was going to be leaving for my appt soon. \n\nRemember that his mom & my grandma live in  the same complex, meaning it would have taken him less than 2 minutes to stop by & pick up the baby. I asked if he could do this because I was very dizzy, I still had to eat, get myself ready, & get the baby ready. I would\u2019ve been able to save a little bit of time & effort if he would have just stopped by to pick up the baby. If I had to drop the baby off, I would\u2019ve spent more time also because his mom talks my ear off even if I say I\u2019m in a rush.\n\nHe said he was not going to come pick her up because he was \u201ctrying to sleep\u201d that he would send his mother instead. His mother has spinal issues and cannot walk down the stairs, especially not with a heavy car seat and diaper bag. Aside from that, I would\u2019ve had to remove the car base from my car & install it in hers, which was going to take me even more time & was going to be hard for me to do with my symptoms. \n\nI get he works over night, & he was \u201ctrying to sleep\u201d but he had been home for the past 4 hrs but when I asked for a favor that I never ask for, he\u2019s trying to sleep. We ended up getting into a bad argument & said some ugly things to each other. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling him off?

He said he'd pay for the car, but I refused to talk to him about it because I didn't want to yell.\n\n\nHe told my husband that he was stressed, having severe depression, & was thinking about inpatient. My husband & I agree that that won't help him. I asked if his friends were the problem, but he got defensive & said it wasn't their fault. I pointed out that nothing in his life should be stressing him out.

My father still gathered all the benefits of being the pater familias he wasn't, with my mother even assuming most of the expenses even though his income was far higher than hers.\n\nI cannot for the life of me recollect any memories involving him. All I could think of is how he would invite his friends home and my mother making sure she was being a welcoming host, the time he went to pick me up at the school I left 4 years beforehand and me knocking on his door to serve him his lunch in his personnal room.\n\nMy parents ended up divorcing after he asked for my mother's permission to take as a second wife one of his students from the university he teaches at (polygamy is legal where I'm from but it's an almost extinct practice that only rednecks ever consider). After horrible episodes of divorce drama (which haven't ended nine years later) he ended up selling half of our property to my mother and gave the other half to me and my sister.

She insisted that she didn't want to buy a \"piece of shit\" and that she could afford to get a \"nicer\" vehicle.\n\nI protested her choices and said I didn't understand why she would pick out Jeeps after the trouble she had with her Grand Cherokee.

I told her she should contact the dealership to take a look at it, and asked her to give me her VIN so I can see if there has been any recalls.\n\nShe said that she \"no longer feels safe\" driving the car and wants a new car. I told her she was overreacting and that we would get it fixed and keep it on the road since it has 50k miles on it. She told me she was \"done\" with this Cherokee.\n\nShe emailed me a bunch of links to cars she \"wants to look at\" and **THEY'RE ALL JEEP FUCKING CHEROKEES.**\n\nI replied by telling her that I don't want to be a part of this search, or the buying process if it's going to be the same as last time.

I am not being an armchair psychologist when I say he has OCD - pretty much everyone who has spent an extended amount of time with him has agreed that he has it. He is deathly afraid of germs and getting sick and even the word \"vomit\" makes him sick. I've tried encouraging him to get help but he puts it off.\n\nHe owns his own apartment which has two bathrooms. I stay there a few nights a week, but usually me staying there comes with rules. Most of the rules are easy to follow, usually simple things like shower before getting into his bed or leaving my shoes near the front the door.\n\nHowever, the reason I'm posting about this, is he has a dumb rule. One bathroom is for peeing, and the other is for pooping. The bathroom in the masterbedroom is the one where we can pee, and the other is for poop. He says it's because it puts him further away when he is in his room. \n\nThe other night I had came over after eating burritos, and woke up to the worst stomachache of my life. Suddenly I had to go, and I just skipped over to the masterbath to relieve myself and, of course, that included going number two. Somehow he had woken up while getting out of bed and he noticed I'd been there for a while. When I came out, he asked if I pooped, and when I said yes he got really frustrated and told me that was the one rule he really didn't want me to break (it's also where he keeps his toothbrush, and now claims he has to get a whole new one). I told him it was ridiculous and I really had to go, and he replied that it was his place and brought up the fact that I don't pay the bills there. That part kind of hurt, because I am in-between jobs and he knows that.\n\nEventually I just packed my stuff up and went home where I can use the bathroom freely.

I didn't get a fever or anything like most do, so by the time it was discovered it was huge and required surgery to drain and clean out.\n\nUnfortunately now I'm nursing from only one side and desperately trying to build my supply up on that side to try and support a rapidly growing baby.

They feel more comfortable with me when dealing with hard homework because while my wife is not a yeller, she easily gets frustrated. When I help with homework and they make mistakes, I expresses my disappointment as well but not in a rude tone like my wife does. Other then the homework issue, overall me and the boys love spending time together. I have rules like all parents should have but I have fun with them. After work, we would disappear to the office at home where I have a couch, a PC and a computer  and play video games, watch really funny movies  and do other activities and the time would fly very fast but not to the point I would forget their bed time.

Which, while I don\u2019t judge him for dropping out, I have a big issue with him keeping it from everyone.\n\nl have an issue because while he was dropped out and lying, both my parents had surgery. (Summer of 2019). So, most of the housework fell on me. The biggest one was taking care of my other brother (20m) who has autism. All while I was starting my first semester at college (thankfully I still live at home while at uni). It was a tough time. Since my brother was lying about school, he would leave the house early in the morning (6am) and wouldn\u2019t be back till late (9-10pm, when my brother and parents are already asleep).\n\nI was already frustrated with doing everything on my own, but at that point, I didn\u2019t know he was lying. I was more upset that he wasn\u2019t appreciative of me at all, and seemingly didn\u2019t give a shit about my parents, especially my mom, who went through a very invasive and painful surgery. He also was always around the house with an extremely bad attitude, snapping at me, barely even speaking to me and basically treating me like a nuisance, like he was a teenager again.\n\nThis treatment and pushing of responsibilities onto me is nothing new. Growing up, when my parents left for a weekend, he would \u201cwatch\u201d my brother and I, but he would completely ignore us or talk to us as if we were the most annoying people on the planet. Didn\u2019t do wonders for my self esteem and, once again, I took care of my other brother on my own. The treatment never left.\n\nAfter he finally came clean about dropping out, he also said he was struggling with depression and didn\u2019t want to tell anyone, because \u201cnobody would understand\u201d.

I\u2019m not sure, but I guess it flipped a switch in him and he\u2019s been acting way nicer and doing nice things. He actually talks to my brother and I like people and is being honest.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s too late for us. I\u2019ve never felt like he\u2019s loved me as a sister and never treated me with respect. I don\u2019t feel like I need to forgive him. But then I feel guilty because I\u2019m sure his therapist is why he\u2019s turning over a new leaf like this. I feel like if I don't open up, I\u2019ll be stifling his growth.

We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.\n\nFast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  \n\nAnyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.\n\nWe then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings.

I was told it was becoming more common for adults to be diagnosed as being on the spectrum due to a better understanding of the disorder. It explains a lot of things but I was in my 30s when I found out so I don\u2019t let it define me.\n\nA little over a year ago my mother in law started to see a man casually and it recently developed into something serious. Her SO has children from previous relationships, one of which is also autistic. Let\u2019s call him Doug. Doug is 12. Despite me being twenty plus years older, my MIL has been pressuring me to hang out with Doug.\n\nMy MIL is usually well intentioned, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I think she has such a desire to be seen as a kind hearted person that she loses sight of certain things.

I also can\u2019t help but feel she wants to look good for her SO. \n\nI feel like on top of the weird factor, it has too much potential to make Doug feel like his autism is defining him. I told both my wife, my MIL and her SO that if Doug wants advice or help I\u2019d be more than willing to help, but I don\u2019t think it needs to be forced on him. My wife and Doug\u2019s dad are understanding of that but my MIL has been huffy and standoffish ever since.

I have to skip my best friend\u2019s 30th birthday dinner for that so now she\u2019s angry at me.\n\nA few months back my best friend asked over group chat if I and our other friends have anything scheduled on the weekend of her birthday because she wants to have a dinner party.

We used to talk every day but she hasn\u2019t said a word to me in three days.

But because it comes across as strange to many people.\n\nBut last weekend, I was going out and drinking with a group from work, and mentioned something about my \"fathers\". My coworker asked whether I have gay dads, and I said no, they were both straight. I grew up in communal living, and was raised by everyone in the community who wanted the role of parenting.\n\n(Apologies if any of this is confusing, English is not my only language and also I know this topic is strange. I just really want input on whether I crossed a line, I think my life has given me different social norms than a lot of people.)\n\nAnyway, my coworker asked me what I meant of that, and I told him that I had many people in the community who were my parents; there were about 50 people in the commune and 15 with parenting as one of their roles. They are parents to me just as much as my biologic mother and father. And I see the other children from the commune as almost my siblings.\n\nMy coworkers had a lot of questions about it, and seemed to see it as something I should have hated. Not having parents in the same way they did, bring brought up with 10 other children and teenagers. \n\nBut I said, No, I loved it.

I had not been trying to call everyone small-hearts. But that's how a couple of the people I was with took it. They jumped into defending their relationship with their wives and children and saying that their children were loved and cared for and not lonely.\n\nI just said that it's all ok, we have had different lives and I'm glad your life has made you happy.

The break-up was very petty on his part, and was the reason that i lost a lot of my old \"friends\". I left everything behind when i left him and basically had to start my life over.\n\nAbout 2 months after i had broken up with him, i started to make some new friends and relationships. Some of these were military people who were in/thinking of joining the military. These people that i met gave me a lot of insight into what military life is like (job stability, challenging environment, getting to move and see some of our country, great pension, ect). These friends by no means painted a pretty picture, they also told me about some of the not so great parts of the training and job, such as, sleeping in the snow during a field ex. They gave me the tools and their own experiences to consider, as well, i did a TON of research on my own about the military and the job that it entailed.\n\nSo in June i decided to apply to join the military for HR (its something i am currently doing as a civilian). In my country it is a very long and tedious process. This process includes a knowledge test, a medical evaluation, an interview, and a lot of background and personal credit checks. I have also been physically training like crazy since this application to try to get in shape and gain as much muscle as i can before i get accepted in and have to go to basic training. So i have basically been working my ass off since i started this application process.

This was a decision that my family has made, and i am my fathers only child, also my parents are divorced. I told my family about me wanting to join the military , and they lost their shit. The one reason that they made clear that they didn't want me to go to the military was because they expect me to \"take over\" the care of my dad in the near future. I feel like this is extremely unfair to me because i have not even had a chance to live my life yet, start a family, and i just left a 5 year long relationship and had to start over.

Given this statament, \"AITA for spoiling a show for my boyfriend to prove a point? | Whenever we watch movies or TV shows together, my boyfriend does this annoying thing where he will try to predict what will happen. He does this continuously throughout the show, at least once ever 5 minutes, and often will interrupt intense moments with his predictions which I find ruins the experience for me. Like, in very suspenseful scenes where a character is obviously in danger, he will say something along the lines of \u201che\u2019s going to die\u201d. I also will add that his predictions are wrong more often than not.\n\nI have talked to him many times and told him that it annoys me and ruins the mood but his behaviour has not changed. I\u2019ve also tried my best to compromise and suggest that we discuss after we finish an episode what we think might happen next or he does it less often and not during important scenes but have not had any success with that. \n\nThis has made me not want to watch any shows or movies with him so I now mainly watch Netflix alone. One show we do still watch together though is Stranger Things. When season 3 came out and I realised that I wasn\u2019t even excited to watch it because I knew he would ruin it for me, I decided to take a stand. \n\nBasically, I binge watched most of the episodes in blissful silence before he came over and we started watching it together. Every time he would make a prediction, if it was right, I would agree with him and, if he was wrong, I would give my own \u201cprediction\u201d based on what actually happens. It took him a while to catch on but as the show progressed I got more and more specific with my \u201cpredictions\u201d until it became obvious that I had already seen it. \n\nWhen he realised what was going on, he was really angry at me for giving him spoilers. I tried explaining to him that while his predictions don\u2019t actually give the plot away, they still spoil the show for me and I wanted him to know how it felt. He then complained that I was being petty and taking revenge for something that isn\u2019t even that bad. However, I believe I was justified as I had tried talking to him and offering compromises but he was unwilling to see things from my perspective or make any effort to change his behaviour. \n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering if what I did was over the top or if I\u2019m being irrational for even finding his habit as annoying as I do.

Given this statament, \"AITA for giving a presentation at school which basically criticizes most people at the school? | So I (17M) am in a bit of a weird position. I'm not the bullied kid. I mean people tried to bully me once, but it just didn't work. I've always had a fierce confidence, so whenever someone tried to bully me and I bit back, they knew it was going to be too much headache and gave up. \n\nNor am I a popular kid. Nor am I considered one of the ''normal'' types who just floats around going unnoticed.\n\nI've always been told by girls that I'm good looking (have sharp jawline and go gym a lot), so looking at me, most people *think* that I'd be one of those popular types, but I just wasn't. I consciously decided *not* to be that stereotype - the fit and athletic jock who is a hit with everyone. I *could* have been that person like my older brother, but I chose not to. \n\nThere's valid criticisms of me too - I'm arrogant, quick to assume and sometimes lack empathy, however I'm self aware and honest about it. \n\nThis brings me to the presentation. In one of my classes, we were tasked with giving an individual presentation on a topic that is important to us - something that is *personal* to us. So of course most people gave topics on a range of issues; ranging from health issues, to societal issues, etc. \n\nMy topic? I used this as a platform to criticize our school. Rather than take aim at the system , I took aim at my school specifically. I didn't name anyone in particular, however I did broadly criticize certain groups. Noone was safe - teachers, jocks, cheerleaders, criticized.\n\nEssentially, my presentation said the following:\n\n- The teachers at the school are lazy and unhelpful. For the most part, they don't pay attention much and seem unbothered in class. \n\n- Many of the girls, especially those who cheerlead (but also those who do not) are too obsessed with social media. My main point here was shallowness. Both guys and girls are shallow, but our school has a bad reputation for instagram wannabes. I said that perhaps those who cheerlead should focus more on academics, and less on empty validation\n\n- Many of the athletes would benefit from being better role models. They are in a position of great responsibility, and yet our town has had multiple instances of these jocks drunk driving and causing damage. There is a high correlation with our school's jocks and drunk driving incidents\n\n- Many on the debate team and choir should seek help for their mental health. This wasn't an indictment of them, but me standing up for them\n\nThe school is a bit clique-y, moreso than other schools I've seen. But **I specifically backed up my presentation with evidence - mainly with statistics and my opinion, backed with some philosophy.**\n\nThe teacher was not happy, but he did not get me in trouble. In fact, I was surprised that he said it was really thoughtful. The other students mostly pissed off. Then some girls called me a huge asshole, that I'm insensitive. I may see their point...I do have a tendency of being insensitive, but my teacher did praise me. AITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA. Yes\nB.

Over the past few years she\u2019s gotten really close to some of the women on the team, including one of my best friends, Jenna \\[29F\\], and started dating another guy on the team, Alex.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 I really dislike Tori. Something about her just rubs me the wrong way. She\u2019s pretty good-looking and I get the impression that she knows it \u2013 I feel like she thinks she\u2019s better than everyone. But everyone else seems to really like her so for the most part I kept these thoughts to myself. I see her 2-3 times a week, so I just made my peace with it and was always nice to her because I didn\u2019t want any drama.  \n\nA few months ago, I matched on Tinder with a girl in Tori\u2019s grad school program, \u201cCat.\u201d We went on a date and Cat mentioned that she\u2019d seen that we had a mutual friend, Tori. I asked Cat what she thought of Tori and Cat was like \u201cshe\u2019s great, I really like her, why do you ask?\u201d I told Cat, basically, that I really dislike Tori and that she seems like kind of a bitch. I generally consider myself an honest person and I was just really tired of pretending to like Tori. \n\nThings fizzled out with Cat and I honestly forgot about that conversation. So last weekend I showed up to our sports game and said hi to everyone. I noticed that Tori didn\u2019t respond super enthusiastically (she was like \u201coh, hey\u2026\u201d) so I asked her what was up and she said \u201cnothing.\u201d I hate it when people are obviously lying to me so I asked her what her deal was. She finally looked at me and said \u201cCat told me that you massively shit talked me on your date. I thought you were my friend and I\u2019m honestly pretty upset, so I\u2019d appreciate if you could just leave me alone.\u201d She said this in front of the entire team and her tone was really aggressive and bitchy. I was pretty pissed and said something like \u201csorry, but Cat asked me what I thought and I was just being honest about my feelings.\u201d \n\nSince then everyone on the team has been telling me that I\u2019m a huge asshole and are basically telling me that I should apologize to Tori or consider taking a break from the team. I\u2019m surprised because (1) I\u2019ve been on the team for longer, and (2) Tori didn\u2019t need to call me out like that in front of the whole team. I honestly assumed that some of my friends felt the same way, so I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re actually siding with Tori. AITA? \n\nTL;DR: I can\u2019t stand this woman on my sports team (Tori) but I\u2019ve always been nice to her to keep the peace. Went on a date with her friend and was honest in my assessment of Tori\u2019s personality. Tori couldn\u2019t handle it and called me out in front of the whole team.

Quite often they don't actually clean my cooking stuff though and I'll have to do it before cooking, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that was bothering me was them staying up late and being generally loud with friends.

I asked them twice to quiet down since we were studying, and it didn't really seem to have any affect. After that, I decided to call the university police and explain the situation. A few minutes later the officers came to the door and ended their party or whatever, which is honestly what I was hoping for, but it ended up going further than that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe officers realized they had cannabis and also put two-and-two together that the couple were living together in the room, against the residence agreement.

Given this statament, \"AITA for buying a cat litter box for my girlfriends parents, and then saying things about how bad the situation was? | This happened yesterday.\n\nBut first a little backstory: Everytime I go to my gf's parents apartment (she lives with them), as soon as I open the entrance door, I can smell a literal cat shit odour. It's not that strong, but still noticeable. My gf tells me that they do \"everything the can\" to minimize the smell, but when I go to the cat's litter box, it's far too small (<10cm in height) and has so little sand in there that the poor cat can't even hide the turds. There's no way, there's so little sand that there are spots where there is none. The cat basically has to unbury a turd to hide another. Almost everytime I go there, I say out loud \"ouh, that smell...\" and sometimes I even said to my gf that she should put more sand in the litter box. Once I even poured sand that they had in the box and the smell vanished.\n\nWell, knowing that problem they had, today I said to my gf \"let's buy a generic box and a lot of sand\". We got shopping and I carefully selected a big box with +-15cm in height and which was pretty big in size. Then I proceeded and bought 3 packs with 4kg sand each. After some time we went back to her home, I greetet everyone with \"Look what I bought!\", put the litter box on the table, opened a pack, poured the whole in there, making 4cm of sand, which was the recom. min. amount of sand. \nHer mum looked at that whole package being gone and said \"gf, that's too much sand, put a little bit back into the pack\", to which I replied \"Nah, that is the recom. amount. The cat must bury her necessities that's why it stank.\" The answer was exactly the same again \"Put some back into the pack.\"\nWhile walking out with the box, I (jokingly) answered \"Nah, if you guys want to be cheap with sand I go get buy more.\"\nI then heard her dad mumble something, but since I didn't understand a word, I moved on.\nWhen I came back, her dad wasn't on the couch anymore, and I heard a loud thump coming from slamming a door.\nAs it turned out (gf told me), her dad said \"Say to your bf he should watch his mouth\" and then almost immediately following with \"I will retire myself\" and then slam his bedroom door.\nI then looked to my gf and asked what's happening, and her response basically was: \"Hey, you were mean and said unnecessary things. They know it and it's inconvenient.\"\nI then just said to her \"You dad is just too serious\", to which she said \"No, you were inconvenient. My parents loved the attitude, but saying those things and calling my parents cheap isn't the right thing to do\". I then told her that I was joking, but apparently it wasn't received well.\nI then felt pretty unwelcomed there and asked to go home.\n\nI know I shouldn't have said exactly what I said, but I did a favor, bought things for a cat that isn't even mine, etc\n\nMy gf even said in the car \"You also wouldn't like it if someone comes into your home, telling that things are smelling bad, etc\", to which I replied: \"I wouldn't mind, even less if the person buys stuff for me.\" to which she disagreed.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I'm currently in the process of sorting various matters out. Two of these are the Mortgage and Life Insurance. \n\nI should firstly make it clear that because we weren't married and had no children I am not next of kin, her parents are.\n\nI discovered today that because the way the Mortgage was set up, I am due to inherit the full mortgage debt to pay back but only half the house, the remainder of the house will go to her parents. This is frustrating for a number of reason, firstly when my fiancee and I set up the Mortgage I recall being asked this question and I don't believe that is the option we chose. I can't prove that so it is what it is. Secondly, the house is hers and mine, no-one else's.. We designed it from the ground up, everything in it is hours of work by us, to now have to share that seems wrong. Thirdly, I truly dont believe this what she would have wanted, it certainly isn't what I would have wanted for her but they're spinning it as \"If this is how she set it up, she must have wanted us to get the house.\" And finally I got on really well with her family, I feel this has made the relationship extremely difficult to maintain. \n\nI'm not sure if it's relevant as to whether IATA but her family are well off, a lot more so than myself or my family. They're not stinking rich but they have a large portfolio of properties and money just isn't an issue for them. I'm by no means struggling, but I earn enough to pay the bills and that's about it.. I can barely afford them now I'm paying them alone.\n\nAlso, possibly relevant possibly not.. every single asset of hers has gone to her parents and I have not said a word. This is the law and that's fine. It probably equates to around \u00a320,000 in total, I have not asked for nor received a penny of this and I am completely comfortable with that fact.\n\nNow, we had joint life insurance which means I'm due a payout equal to the remainder of the mortgage. To me, this is my money to do with as I please. I paid the premiums to cover my mortgage in case the worst should happen, which it did. My solution is that I either give her parents half the money we've paid off the house and they sign it over to me or we sell the house and share whatever money is raised. Either way, I keep the life insurance money.\n\nTheir solution is that I pay off the full mortgage and we share the house 50/50.

We have clashed a few times over a myriad of issues, but we mostly make it through the day, and are both experienced in our field.\n\nSo anyway, one day an auditor came in for a surprise inspection, and unfortunately, I was dinged for a few items. No big deal really. My supervisor educated me on it, and I learned from my mistake.

I found out through some coworkers that Steph emptied the jar, and spent the money on \u201csodas for lunch.\u201d Apparently, our supervisor bought everyone pizza one day, but no drinks. Steph was a little upset about this, so she used the jar money on beverages for the team. I was visibly upset about this and approached Steph the next time we worked together to ask to her to please return the money. She replied \u201cWell, our supervisor neglected to buy us beverages for the pizza, so I used the money for that\u201d. I reminded her that the jar money was not for that purpose, and to please return the money. Steph then replied \u201cOnce our supervisor pays me the money she owes me for the party rentals, I\u2019ll return the jar money\u201d (At this point I should mention that we had our Xmas party at Steph\u2019s house.

She still goes to church and i stopped going when i was 12. So I\u2019m not very religious. She\u2019s never been homophobic, but her husband is a different story. She grew up with him because they met in church. but yes, he does have a different opinion than my sister. So my nephew came out to them and his dad wasn\u2019t so understanding.\n\nIt ended up in an argument with all of them, i don\u2019t know the full details, but his dad did say some hateful things. I don\u2019t have kids or anyone to take care of so i\u2019ve always been close to my nephews and nieces. My nephew called me up and asked if i could pick him up. I live 3 hours away, i didn\u2019t know if i would be able to go, but he was crying and overall sounded like he was hurt. It was 8 pm at that point, but i just drove. I tried calling my sister before i went, but she didn\u2019t pick up. And my nephew refused to pass her the phone. Once i reached my sisters house, i talked to her for a bit and she decided that it was best for my nephew to stay with me for the weekend. She told me her husband left soon after the argument was finished. \n\nI didn\u2019t hear from them until this morning. He\u2019s threatening to call the police on me, but i\u2019m not really concerned about that. (my sister won\u2019t let him) The thing that annoyed me was he claimed that i was showing him that you could run away from your issues. He also said that he better be back by sunday morning for church and i refused.

Given this statament, \"AITA Auto Accident Settlement | I got into a car accident a few days ago. My sister was driving, and I was in the passenger seat (there were also two other people in the car). We were rear-ended on the highway because traffic was slowing down rapidly due to construction. It was the other person's fault, they admitted that to the officer. After the accident, my neck was very tight and I was considering going to the doctor over the next few days if the pain didn't go away. My sister calls to make a claim and I made sure to have her let the insurance agent know that I was having neck pain. My sister told me that her neck hurt too, but not as bad as mine did.\n\nNow, a few days later, I get a call from the other person's insurance company asking for details. I told them that my neck is better, I'm just a little sore. They offered a decent amount as a settlement, although not a large amount (I don't think the actual dollar value is relevant). I figured I should accept because I'm feeling much better and the soreness is almost gone. So we proceeded with that. I then let my sister know about their settlement offer because I was going to see if they offered her one as well. Turns out she didn't let them know that she was hurt, because she didn't think it was too serious.\n\nNow she thinks that she should get some of the money they offered me because she was in the accident as well. She said that it wasn't fair for me to make money off of her misfortune, so I should pay her some of the money. However, I don't think that she is entitled to the settlement money because she chose not to make a claim.

Given this statament, \"AITA for smoking weed on my patio, even though it disturbs my neighbor? | I have been living in my apartment for a little over 6 months now. During this time I've had no problems sitting on my patio and enjoying a pipe or a joint. \n\nHowever, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time I saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, I said hello and introduced myself, the woman complimented my dog and that was that. Later on that night, I decide to bring my (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, I'd heard them talking on their patio for a while, so I knew they were out there but I didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after I started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. I thought ok whatever. But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).\n\nSo it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While I know that I'm not breaking any rules (legal in my state and confirmed with the apartment when I first moved in that it was a smoking community) and am allowed to do what I'm doing, I kind of feel bad going out when I know they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while. But at the same time I've been here much longer and it's always been fine, so I don't want to have to change my habits for their sake, especially since they haven't said anything directly to me and instead have been a little rude about it.\n\nWIBTA if I just kept smoking?

She hired herself and I a DJ, but had way more elaborate decorations and expensive food for hers. She completely transformed our backyard and our friends and family ranted and raved. She had beautiful cheese platters and little finger foods. I couldn\u2019t afford much so mine was a pretty run of the mill baby shower, but she knew that.
