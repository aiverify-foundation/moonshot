Recently put up an advert for an \"lake view suite\" which is basically one of the attic rooms looking onto a lake behind the house full of supermarket trolleys and rubbish, with a couple of honest photo of the room. Description was basically \"room for a younger guy who lives for the pub and not the office, sharing kitchen/bathroom with 4 others.

He apparently thought it was an actual penthouse despite the price and the room was just a placeholder photo, kicked off pretty much immediately once he saw what a dump the place is and asked for his deposit back. Refused, we argued a bit, eventually told him he isn't getting it back, he can stay for the month and can call the police if there's an issue.

He directs their shows and I\u2019ve been to see a lot of them. I used to work as a receptionist/admin assistant at a performing arts school, which is how we met as his company rented rooms at ours and he chatted and one thing lead to another \n\nHowever a year ago, I got diagnosed with severe depression. I\u2019d had it a while, but it got so bad I ended up with suicidal thoughts and had to leave my job. My boyfriend has stuck by me through all of this even though it hasn\u2019t been easy \n\nSo for a year I\u2019ve been out of work. I\u2019m at a point now where I\u2019m better and have been trying for a lot of jobs.

Let\u2019s put my name forward. \n\nHe asks me for an interview. It goes great and it\u2019s clear I can do it. However in the interview he says something which hurts me. \u201cI know it\u2019s been hard for you, and being second best to your boyfriend all the time can\u2019t be easy, in terms of career success...\u201d I leave feeling hurt but brush it off as I really want the job.\n\nHe asks me to come for a \u201csecond interview\u201d even though he knows me well, but I do it. My boyfriend tells me there\u2019s no way I can\u2019t get this job as he knows what I did before. And has recommended me. \n\nAfter that, I get an email telling me I was unsuccessful. My boyfriend is confused so I write an email asking for feedback. I get a call instead, he says \u201cDon\u2019t take it out on us please.\u201d I explain I\u2019m not and my email had been professional. He says \u201cLook, we don\u2019t want you and that\u2019s that. Don\u2019t act like a spoiled child. We saw more talented candidates and even though I know you personally I can\u2019t take someone on out of pity because they\u2019re not doing so great\u201d\n\nNow this would\u2019ve been an okay answer if I was still struggling with depression but I\u2019m not and told him in the interview I\u2019m ready to go back to work. The role was exactly the same as the job I had. Same admin work, literally the lowest paid job, sorting papers, taking cash from kids. Phoning the parents. I\u2019d just be with him in an office doing that. It\u2019s hardly \u201ctalent\u201d so he doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nI found him very arrogant.The way he spoke to me proves he thinks less of me. My boyfriend agrees he was rude however refuses to say anything as his job is important Since this guy will be in the audience in my boyfriends shows I told him I don\u2019t want to come see them or support his work at all.\n\nWe argued and he\u2019s mad at me because it\u2019s nothing to do with him.

We accidentally ordered it to her house not mine, quickly realised our mistake but couldn\u2019t find a way of cancelling our order and the app said to contact the driver about address changes which we couldn\u2019t do until he\u2019d picked up the food. As soon as we could, we messaged explaining and gave the new address, thinking he could decide to cancel if it was too far to drive. The app made it so hard to amend our order, cancel it or contact the driver any better. Didn\u2019t want to call him as he could get in legal trouble if caught driving on the phone. He read our message but didn\u2019t respond at all. We saw his car coming and assumed he was delivering to my house with no issue.\n\nHe comes to the door and I greet/thank him, then he says how the address was different so I tried to apologise and explain but I never got to. He interrupted and said he only did the delivery out of the kindness of his soul and usually after 7 minutes with no collection would trash the food and move on. He said that Uber doesn\u2019t pay him the extra fuel for driving to my house instead of my GF\u2019s. He paid it out of his own pocket and kept saying how he didn\u2019t have to. I got no words in as he was giving me this long lecture about the order. He asked that I tip even as little as \u00a32 because it helps him out and I saw where he was coming from so agreed to tip something, apologised again and he finally let me have my food and go. The order was on my GF\u2019s account as she\u2019d paid so I was prepared to send her money to cover a reasonable tip. \n\nWhen I got the food inside I expressed my exhaustion at the lecture. He was talking for way longer than needed for me to get the point and wouldn\u2019t let me defend myself, but I know customer jobs can be hell and he seemed nice enough and genuine. I can\u2019t say how he would have been if it were not late at night meaning he had to keep his voice down. Anyway, my GF thought he was completely unprofessional, wanted to not tip and leave a bad review. I tried to defend him saying to give a tip like he asked and she\u2019d agree if she\u2019d been there. We compromised and she didn\u2019t leave him negative feedback but didn\u2019t tip or leave positive feedback either. I would have felt terrible in case he lost his job. I still feel bad, but my GF thinks otherwise and I really had to convince her to just leave the review alone. She said it\u2019s not our fault Uber won\u2019t pay him, that\u2019s the company\u2019s problem not ours, he could have cancelled etc. I agree that Uber sucks here, but should we have tipped because he did a nice thing delivering it anyway or was he really unprofessional?\n\nTLDR: Unable to amend food delivery address and could\u2019t contact driver properly or cancel.

We have 2 houses, one we all live in and another we have on rent, but the money that we are charging her is going into the general household pot since both girls have expensive tastes and so grocery bills and electricity bills are high. The money from our 2nd home on rent goes into savings.\n\nMy 22 year old doesn\u2019t have a problem at all with paying the rent, and both girls are close, both with each other and us. However I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being unfair to 1 daughter over the other, as my wife is now starting to rethink the rent decision and thinks it would be better if we charged neither.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I've got no time to spoil and, like everyone else, my week of work weights heavily on me.\n\nUnfortunately and even more in this particular instance, parties including my step mother's family are the apotheosis of loneliness for me. Socializing with these people I don't care about is just exhausting, and I've got absolutely NO benefits of being here. It's just boring, tiring and annoying.\n\nI told my father a couple days before the event that I wasn't gonna be here this year. I see them about once every week or twice a month, and I didn't think that my presence mattered that much. Turns out, after the fact, that my whole family has turned against me because of it, including my oversea grandparents (which I didn't get along too well with in the first place) who have nothing to do in this matter but were somehow told of my OUTRAGEOUS offense.\n\nAccording to all of them, (excepted for my big brother who told me and my little brother who probably didn't even notice as a problem the fact that I wasn't here, will check on that when I see him, though) birthdays are big and important events of one's life and the fact that I was the only one missing is BAD. It makes me look like I don't care about my brother, family is sacred and missing a birthday party is a sin. On top of that I think they were uneasy and upset to have to explain to other guests why his own sister wasn't even attending his birthday.\n\nI'm expecting quite a speech about all of this. My own birthday is next weekend, and I'm afraid that my stepmom won't come over because of this or they will tell me about their disappointment there, most likely ruining the mood for everyone.\n\nAITA for staying home to relax and enjoy my weekend instead of going to this party I would have absolutely hated?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I raised a fit asking how the fuck could I qualify for a Catholic scholarship, especially as I had zero church involvement and would never write an essay about it.

I had to pack up DS and DD and leave our home and leave my sick husband by himself. I went to MILs house, explained the situation, and asked for her help. She refused to help us. After my husband got better, she laughed at me and rubbed my nose in the fact that I asked for help and didn\u2019t get it.  We told her how hurt we were by the way she treated us, but she refused to acknowledge our feelings and refused to apologize. Needless to say, I never asked for her help again. \n\nShe moved out of our area a couple of years later, which was a relief for me. Since then, she has completely ignored us other than Christmas cards for the kids with a check inside and late birthday cards for the kids. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for the last 15 years. \n\nWell, she recently moved back to our area. She didn\u2019t even tell us she was moving. My husband got a text from his sister telling him when and where to be to help with moving day. That was the only communication. \n\nOut of the blue, MIL started showing up at my DDs school events, uninvited. You have to realize, she\u2019s a stranger to DD. My DD is shy and introverted. She\u2019s the kind of person that you have to win her trust. It creeped DD out when MIL started showing up at her events. It made her nervous and self conscious. I didn\u2019t think it was fair for her to just show up after all this time and make DD uncomfortable. \n\nSo........I explained to MIL that my children had never in their life had a support system other than me and DH. I told her that she was making DD uncomfortable and that she shouldn\u2019t just show up at events without an invitation.

She can be kind of reliant on me for a lot of stuff, she is a bit... sheltered I suppose. She grew up mostly with my mom and I grew up with my dad, so we had very different childhoods, and sometimes it feels like she cant do anything herself without calling for someone to do it for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe spent a weekend in Pennsylvania at a friends house, she had her friend Cheryl drive her there, but then apparently Cheryl got into a car crash (minor injuries, but car broken) at some point in the weekend and my sister was stuck without a ride home. So naturally, she calls me and asks me to pick her up. On that day? No, she wants me to pick her up the next morning, because she wanted to go to some bar with her friends that night. I told her, look, you have time to figure out how to get home. There are buses, trains etc which can bring you home. She scoffed at the idea of that, and started complaining that she hated the idea of taking public transportation all the way back, and that she cant even stand taking the subway 30 minutes to her classes back home. She also said she knew she was going to be hungover, and that she would rather die than be on some bus hungover all the way back. She said she also didn't know how to get to the bus area, and I said she can pretty easily look it up, she is in a city, not some small rural town. The entire conversation was just so frustrating to me. She wanted me to drive over 3+ hours to pick her up, then 3+ hours back, all because she is too lazy to take public transportation? I get it can be difficult to figure your way around in a new city and all that, but guess what? You just got to figure it out somehow. I told her no, she has to figure it out on her own, and that I cant just ruin my entire sunday by driving all the way to PA. She was obviously very upset, and eventually started to curse at me and I just hung up. I'm not gonna lie, I was in a pissy mood before she even called, but either way the entire request seemed silly to me. \n\nShe made it home, but apparently she complained to just about everyone in our family. My mom, dad, brother called or texted saying that I should have picked her up (they all live upstate, so they couldnt have) and that she was basically stranded and she could have gotten killed and all this stuff.

Both our leases were coming to an end and she came to me and asked me if I wanted to finally move in together. I was very excited and told her yes.

We'll call my daughter Annie and her son Tommy. I have custody of Tommy because, at the time of his birth, Annie was on drugs. She's been sober and living with me for 2 years now. At this point, I still do not trust Annie with caring for Tommy full time/by herself considering she doesn't have enough patience/responsibility to care for a 3 year old, especially one that has a severe illness (cystic fibrosis). She still barely understands his illness (Annie asked me the other day why can't they just give him new lungs so that she doesn't have to do all of the work that goes into his care when she gets custody) and has refused to take over or even learn how to deal with all the insurance and hospital jazz.\n\nGoing back to the fight, Annie was pissed off because she thought she wanted the keys to my car. She said she had to go somewhere, but didn't specify where. I (nicely) asked here where and if she needed gas money and she just flipped out of nowhere. She threw one of Tommy's toys at the TV, cracked it, and then went on a rant about how I don't trust her and that she's a grown woman who can do whatever she wants. Mind you, almost a year ago, she crashed my car and blamed me for allowing her to use it.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not telling my fianc\u00e9e about my past? | So a little background info here. Between the ages of 13-17, I was a pretty shitty teen who got into a lot of trouble. From smoking weed, underage drinking, skipping school, getting into fights, and stealing my neighbor's car for a joyride. I ended up in juvie at 16 and didn't really start to change my life around until a year later when my mom passed away. That will always be one of my greatest regrets, but this post isn't about that.\n\nAfter completing several programs and doing a ton of community service, I was able to get my records sealed at 18 and get a fresh start in life. I got my GED, went to college, got a job that I've been at for 9 years now and am currently in an upper management role. My life has taken a complete 180. I'm a law-abiding citizen. I bought a house a couple years ago, my student loans and both my cars are paid off. I don't ever look back at the past, just focus on what's ahead. I have even completely avoided people from my past, especially those I know never grew up from that teenager phase.\n\nI recently got engaged to a woman I had dated for 2 years. While I've shared many things about my life with her, I've never talked about my past as a juvenile delinquent. I just never thought it was important enough to bring up or that it would have any meaning in our relationship. I'm 33 now, so everything happened 16 years ago. I've made big changes in my life, and who I was as a teenager literally has nothing to do with who I am now as an adult.\n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9e posted our engagement photos on her social media, one of her online friends from a group pointed out that she knew me. This sparked a private conversation between my fianc\u00e9e and her, where my fianc\u00e9e learned that this woman used to party with me as well as buy weed from me back in high school. The woman also mentioned I went to juvie and she never saw me again, so she was curious about how I was doing. Obviously this was all news to my fianc\u00e9e, who immediately texted me and said we needed to talk when I got home.\n\nWell I've been home for a couple hours now, and my \"talk\" with my fianc\u00e9e has consisted of her ranting at me for 45 minutes. She feels like I was trying to hide my past from her, doesn't understand why I never mentioned it to her, feels like I'm hiding other things about myself, etc. She's angry and embarrassed that she had to find all this out from an online acquaintance and not directly from the source. I have not apologized to my fianc\u00e9e, because I don't feel that I have anything to be sorry for. My years as a teenager are not relevant to my current way of living, and it wasn't something I felt needed to be shared nor do I feel I should be judged for my idiocy back then.\n\nI am not looking for relationship advice. I am not looking for people to tell me what I should or should not do.

I was incredibly excited to get to see all my friends from the group who live all over the country, and to party!\n\nThe bride offered her house for us to stay at for the two nights we were there. This is a typical arrangement for the group I am a part of because it requires a lot of travel and the community is very supportive. Before we left home, my boyfriend and I decided to gift $200 both as a wedding gift and a thank you for giving us a place to stay. (Alternate accommodations would have been around $50 per night)\n\nGoing to the wedding required both me and my boyfriend to take time off of work (costing me somewhere around $100 and him around $200), required me to buy a new dress to match the color theme ($100), and required a 20hr round trip drive.\n\nUp until this point, everything was fine and I was happy to sacrifice my time and money to be with my friend on her special day. When we got to the ceremony, I knew absolutely no one. I was surprised because the bride said she was inviting everyone from our group. As the ceremony started, I realized that all of the other people in the group at the wedding were bridesmaids. I'm not gonna lie, that really hurt, but at this point I was still fine - maybe she was closer with those girls, and we would still have fun and hang out at the reception.\n\nThen we get to the reception, and there's no alcohol. Or, I guess to be more specific, they are not serving any alcohol, but a subset of people were apparently told that the event would be BYOB and have their own personal alcohol for their groups (again, me and my boyfriend know absolutely no one). My boyfriend immediately said we'd given too much money for a wedding without an open bar and a plated dinner (they had a barbecue buffet).\n\nWe stuck around awkwardly for awhile and eventually all the bridesmaids arrived. They came over to chat and it was immediately apparent that they felt incredibly awkward that they were bridesmaids and I wasn't, they had all been there since the middle of the week to catch up and had established a bunch of inside jokes, and they were really just saying hi to be polite (after a very awkward few minutes of conversation, they left to continue circulating around the reception).\n\nI told my boyfriend that I just wanted to go home, and we left as soon as we could without even touching the food and drove the 10 hours home that night. As we were leaving, he said I should cancel the check and save us both $100. At first I agreed because that's a lot of money for me right now, and I don't plan on having a relationship with any of those girls after this.

She said that I could get out at one of their houses and find a way home from there.

I assure her that she isn't fat, which is true and she is very skinny, but she still insists that she is *huge* and needs to lose weight to feel better about herself. Now, I'm an overweight fella and it makes me VERY self-conscious, but I never bring it up to her because I know it would make her more upset. \n\nMy girlfriend has been sending me posts via Instagram about weight loss pills, fad diets, etc. This has been going on for months and she often asks if I will help her go on diets, if I will buy her pills, etc. I have agreed multiple times to try and diet with her but she always gives up and says that I think she's fat when I try to push her to keep going. I always say no to buying diet pills (no FDA regulation). \n\nWhen she sends me the various Instagram posts, it makes me really upset. I feel like she's sending them to me because she thinks that I am fat and need these diets and stuff.

She responded angrily.\n\nGF: \"You're such a dick\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry. It makes me upset and I don't like it\"\n\nGF: \"Fine. I'm just going to stop talking to you at all because it makes you upset\"\n\nMe: \"When you send me the diet stuff it makes me really self-conscious GF.

I've never mentioned it because she has bipolar disorder, and as I struggle with depression I fully understand how food can take the edge off when you get seriously overwhelmed with depression. But for health reasons and of course other reasons, of course I would like for her to get back to a healthy weight. \n\nMy girlfriend's bipolar disorder has been a challenge for me, as where I would normally be assertive in a relationship on issues - I often have to back down in arguments because she responds poorly to being challenged. I often feel like I'm walking on ice, but I do my best to try understand her and work at helping her and supporting her as best I can. \n\nShe is not happy with her current weight, and constantly remarks about it and has been complaining about it for over a year without doing anything about it. \n\n I tell her we can work on it together as a team, and both fix our diet. I feel this is the best way to go about it, rather than telling her that SHE needs to lose weight. I don't want her feeling like I'm initiating it, or that it's a journey she needs to take alone. Or that I'm pushing her to do it. For it to be a healthy journey, it needs to be something she is motivated to do and if I do it with her, then it doesn't feel like it's all on her.\n\nSo, last week she decided to work on her diet. She was upset today because she hasn't lost any weight yet. I told her to not worry about the short term results - that it had only been a week, but to focus on months down the line to see changes. She was extremely defeatist and said she'll never lose weight. This kinda irritated me, because it had only been a week since she started. \n\nI felt like she hadn't fully committed, because she was drinking soft drinks and eating chips which are high in carbs so I brought that up, if she wants to see results quicker - that cutting out the junk food completely (rather than cutting down) will help her. Now I understand she's trying to make a change, but the defeatist attitude after only a week is difficult to work with. \n\nShe then got angry at me and told me to \"stop arguing with me about my weight\". To which I replied that I wasn't, I had never in our entire relationship brought up her weight, and was just discussing her diet and how she was eating and drinking things that will make her progress slower. \n\nShe then told me to drop it and leave it alone, and is now in a huff with me for the past few hours over it.

She has called it her religion and she is worried that if we have kids I wont instill the same values she has for the environment. My thought here is, why does the kid have to have her values?\n\nSince she calls it a religion, I tell her its not fair to impose her beliefs on others and that I shouldn't have to live my life 100% aligned to her values, but now she  wants me to apologize for touching the tree and I'm digging in my heels.\n\nThoughts?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Prior to this I had been renting for the last 7 years and moved on average every two years due to the landlord selling or wanting to move back into the flat themselves. \n\nMy sister (28F) married a year ago to a man from overseas and has recently managed to bring him over. In the meantime she has secured a flat to rent, near to her workplace and she and her husband have both moved in. A week after she moved in, my brother (M23) bought her an item of furniture for \u00a3150. Prior to finding out about this gift from him, I was helping my sister unpack and settle in. I noticed a cute wall hanging and asked her where she got it, and she commented that it was a house warming present from our brother. I asked if he got her anything else, and she mentioned some cute floral mugs but didn't comment any further. \n\nMy older sister (F33) mentioned what a generous gift my brother had given to our sister, and to my surprise, mentioned this item of furniture. I don't know if I was an asshole to feel hurt I did not receive anything, and I actually bought a house which was a big deal. It isn't the price tag, I don't care how much he spent on her, I just felt hurt he didn't get me anything. I saved up for 7 years whilst renting to be able to afford to buy my own home. Even when I did manage to get on the property ladder, I couldn't afford to furnish my home, and only had a sofa, TV and a mattress. It wasn't until 6 months later until I could afford bedroom furniture and a dining table set. I do not expect my family to help me afford furniture in any way, I was more than content with what I had and just happy I was no longer renting, of which I had previously done so for years. \n\nI texted my brother asking what he bought our sister and he confirmed the item of furniture. I responded with a jokey text just saying he won't have to spend too much on a gift for me. He replied he was just going to give me some cash the next time he sees me. I couldn't help feel hurt as I bought a house a year ago, and this was a significant achievement for me. This was my sisters first time renting as prior to this she was living at home with our parents.

She was a little bit forward, which was somewhat unsettling.\n\nBut we went back to my place and things got weird from there. She started demanding that I order pizza because she was hungry.

She said, \"wait, where are you going!?\"\n\nWithout looking back or slowing down I yelled, \"it's an emergency!\"\n\nShe was pissed. Started sending me angry texts.

TikTok is majoritarily used by underaged teens, and R's fanbase is almost fully composed by teenaged girls who aren't even 18 yet.\n\nThe problem is that R is *always* promoting her onlyfans account. She made it some weeks ago and most of her stories on Instagram promote her onlyfans - not only that, she romanticizes it a lot. A example I can give you is a post she made saying something in the lines of \"selling packs ((we call them nude packs in my language, not sure if it's the same in english)) is great; you don't have to stop working even in the pandemics!\"\n\nHonestly that made it for me.

I called a local business that had good reviews (several hundred reviews). They said it would be extra to come out on the weekend so I asked if they could come out on Monday. I figured I could suck it up for a day. They make the appointment and tell me it will be $40 for them to come out. \n\nThe next day rolls around and I leave work a bit early to be home for the 4:00 service call. I wait and wait, but it gets to be 5:00 and no one is there. I call them and ask where the repair person is. Apparently I was never put into the system. They apologize and agree to get someone out ASAP that day. They tell me it\u2019s going to be $75 for the service call. I explain that I was told $40 on Sunday. She says that they did have a discount but you had to mention when you called. She eventually agrees to go with the price I was originally told and was very nice about it saying, \u201cif you were told $40 that\u2019s what we\u2019ll charge.\u201d\n\nThe repair guy shows up and he fiddled around for about 10 minutes and then comes and says to me that he\u2019s done all he can for $40 and if I want anything else done it\u2019s a $150 diagnostic charge. Well I\u2019m stuck in a 89 degree house and it\u2019s too late to call anyone else so I say \u201csure whatever\u201d. He spends a few more minutes and discovers a loose wire. He fixes the loose wire in about 5-10 minutes comes down out of my attic and tells me it will be $300 total. So to recap it was $40 for the service call, $150 for the diagnosis, and $110 for him to strip and reattach a wire. I was never told about the $150 diagnostic charge when I called them to come out. Well I pay because I\u2019m burning up and he\u2019s not the guy to take this up with anyway. I leave a one star review on their business explaining all of this. Well a week later their business replies saying they\u2019re reversing my charge and giving a full refund. I didn\u2019t necessarily want a full refund. I would have been happy paying about 180-200 for the work. I know I\u2019m paying for his expertise not the speed  or ease of the repair. I just felt it was predatory that I wasn\u2019t told upfront about the $159 diagnostic charge.  I feel kind of bad keeping the refund but they gave it to me and my dad says I should just keep it. \n\nSo AITA leaving my review up and just keeping the full refund? I\u2019m going to go and reply to them thanking them for it and explain that I wish they had been upfront about all potential charges, but I\u2019m not going to change my review because other people should know and people usually check the one star section. \n\ntl;dr repair company was shady with their charges and did not tell me about a $150 charge before coming out.

It hurt so bad right at first, and there is probably going to be more pain as I deal with it, but at least this way I\u2019ll actually move on and not do the same thing to myself that she was doing to herself that created this situation in the first place\n\nTHEM: I think the lesson is to be careful about getting invested too quickly, especially before you\u2019ve talked about what you\u2019re looking for\n\nME: I\u2019d rather not have anyone trying to tell me lessons to take from this. I knew exactly what type of pain I was risking throughout this process and actively chose to take that risk based on my personal values. I took that risk because I knew I would have to tools at my disposal to deal with this pain if/when it came, and now I\u2019m going to work through it, and that work is going to include some crying and complaining as I let myself feel the pain for the time that it needs to be felt. Please don\u2019t try to preach to me about how to handle these types of things again. If I want advice rather than an ear to vent to, I will ask for it.\n\nTHEM: \ud83d\ude05 nvm I guess, back to the poly stuff (what everyone else was talking about while we talked about this)\n\nME: I don\u2019t mean to go off \ud83d\ude02 I just know where I\u2019m at the process that went into the choices that I made in a way that you don\u2019t because I haven\u2019t posted enough context on this server for any of y\u2019all to, and getting told what I should take from this by someone that does have that full context just rubs me the wrong way, especially while I\u2019m still in this painful place about it. No worries though \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nTHEM: I was trying to help bc that\u2019s what I did with the girl I liked before this one, and especially because no one else answered your message. It rubs me the wrong way to have it taken in such a negative way and I don\u2019t know what else to say about it given that. Good luck with dealing with all of that, it\u2019ll eventually get better no matter what\n\nI didn\u2019t answer\n\nOTHER GROUP CHAT PEOPLE: \u201dawkwaaard\u201d gifs\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

He would send birthday and Christmas gifts. Yes, he is my son's father, but if he doesn't want to initiate a relationship by actually talking to him why should I let him have one?\n\nAbout sophomore year in highschool, Sam's grades began to drop. He went from As and Bs to Cs. He started to play Fortnite more. He began to win some tournaments, told me about sponsorships, but I disliked him playing so much. I made it known that I did not approve of his \"hobby\", (I see it as borderline addiction) and that it would never be a sustainable source of income. He understood that.\n\nThis is about when summer started and Sam began taking college classes. (Just to get ahead). He just finished. In one of his classes, he did very well. (Psychology, with an A). But in the other, he did very bad. (Sociology with a D). \n\nAbout the time that this \"fortnite world cup\" stuff started (early June?) Sam began playing an unhealthy amount. He said that he had a chance to do something cool, but I just saw it as feeding his addiction. This was also the time that is sociology grade begin to slip. As a consequence we took away his gaming stuff and in turn \"prevented him from competing in a once in a lifetime opportunity\". I said if his poor grades continued then I would have to keep him from volunteering as well. (He loves volunteering, but it was getting in the way of grades almost as much as gaming). That would leave him with nothing to do but getting good grades and helping around the house.\n\nIn the last week, he told me that he would finish high school and then move to Texas to start his life. (to live with his bio. father until he could get his own place). His reasoning was that it much cheaper to find housing and to live there overall. It would be easier to find jobs. All these random points that hide his true reasoning for moving away.\n\nWe got into a very heated argument which I encountered the first time he ever raised his voice at me. He said that I wasn't being supportive of him. He said that my standards of him were too high. His said that I was taking away anything I could that he cared about. He said that I was too controlling and that I wouldn't listen to what he had to say. He went to his room. I was left crying out of confusion and disappointment. He doesn't understand how hard I have worked to give him the childhood that I never got. (Raised in Oakland slums by parents who were always on drugs.) I went to school for for eight years to get my masters degree. All for him to pick a career that he doesn't have to go to college for.

Her social media is full of pictures of cats, video games and cartoon. \n\nFor group bonding I(37F) am usually the one organizing outings and travels, and usually Jan's opinions get passed because it does not go well with majority of us. For example, for traveling she would suggest beaches and amusement parks while most of us prefer shopping centres and sightseeing. As time pass by Jan had stopping giving opinions and just go with the flow.\n\nWhenever we have outings Jan would also be the one carrying our bags as some of us would bring kids along. Despite being nice in general Jan has a rather low tolerance for children, and would visibly back off when the kids start making noise, which some of us, including me, find rude.\n\nNot long ago Jan had an argument with one of the other ladies, Mira(40s). Unlike Mira and most of the other ladies, when Jan snap she started swearing and with a sharp tongue rapped a whole load of curses at Mira. The argument(too long a story) ended with Mira storming off and Jan pointing finger at her.\n\nI called Jan up and had a talk with her. Jan told me that since she's usually a shut-in, she didn't mind joining us for outings as they are the only times she get social, if at all. However, she admitted having a hard time blending into the group as our age and likings differ too much and she couldn't enjoy herself.\n\nI am considering removing Jan from the group as the other ladies are showing distaste towards her after the her argument with Mira, calling her immature and vulgar, and to top that off she dislike kids. Also, since Jan has already told me that she wasn't enjoying herself removing her may be for the better.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA. Yes\nB.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not letting my brother, who was recently paralyzed with nothing to do, borrow my PS4? | Some backstory: Me and my (1 year older) brother have not been on good terms in a long time. In school he was my biggest bully, and as he got older things got worse.  He lived a violent, reckless lifestyle, always getting into fights, getting involved in gang activity. He's been to jail multiple times, and honestly it was a reprieve for me and my mom when he was locked up, cause it was hell living with him. He'd threaten violence (most often implied, sometimes outright) to me and her if he didn't get his way. He even put his hands on her once - that was the only time I ever fought back against him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe hasn't been above stealing from family either. He stole my mom's money or car multiple times. He's \"borrowed\" money from other families claiming he was gonna use it to go to school or get a car for work, only to use it to buy drugs to sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving been a broke kid in high school to being an even broker college student, I didn't often have much of value for him to steal. But I was always an avid gamer, so my game consoles were an exception. He's stolen systems from me three times in my life. After the most recent incident, I swore I'd never let him in my life again. A couple years passed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen he got shot. I wasn't surprised. No one was. We all knew his lifestyle would get him shot eventually. He survived, but is permanently paralyzed from the chest down. I didn't go see him when he was in the hospital. I was glad he wasn't dead, but I had meant it when I said I would no longer let him into my life. Everyone told me he was doing better, no longer running the streets (like he'd be able to), that he was settling down. My mom, as much of a pain in the ass he was to her, still loved him, and  wanted me to forgive him. But I refused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen. . . my mom died a month ago. . .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI knew I'd be seeing him at the wake. And I knew my mom would want for me not to hate him. So I resolved to give him a chance. And, yeah, he was much calmer, more mature then ever before. I had the first decent conversation with him in years. I told him that I forgave him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few minutes ago he contacted me for the first time since the wake, asking to borrow my PS4. He says he's bored out of his mind not being able to really go outside, and he needs something to do, and I mean, I understand that and feel for him. But I REALLY don't want to let him. Partially cause I just got it half a year ago, partially cause of the history. But I feel like a dick for not letting him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo.

Given this statament, \"AITA for leaving my Airbnb host a rude message? | A while ago, I stayed at an Airbnb with my dog. The owner was a nurse and came back home late at night after we had settled in. My dog is skittish and she barked at the owner, who must have seemed like an intruder in her new home. Thankfully the owner seemed very understanding.\n\nThe next day we met the owner\u2019s own dog. It was a small Dachshund and it barked a lot at my dog. The owner said sorry for the barking and from then on put him in her room whenever we came out.\n\nThe third day, I was eating dinner with my dog in the dining room, which shared a glass wall with the sunroom where the owner's cats stayed. My dog hates cats and started growling at them when she saw them through the glass, just as the owner walked out of her room. The owner let out a big sigh and angrily said \"Can I give you some advice? I've had dogs all my life and it's not cool for your dog to growl at me. You gotta be firm with them and nip that in the bud or they'll walk all over you.\"\n\nI was flabbergasted and just replied \u201cOK,\u201d but I got more mad as I thought about it afterwards.\n\nFirst of all she wasn't even growling at the owner, she was growling at her cats. Second, I didn't appreciate that she implied that I was not a good owner and was being walked over. Every single time she barked or growled I was doing my best to stop her and make her feel safe, even if it might not have seemed as firm or effective as the owner thought. Third, her own dog barked like crazy and she had even less control of him. I felt betrayed by a fellow reactive dog owner who I thought was understanding.\n\nIt was only after I ended my stay that I made my frustrations known. I didn't give her a bad review but left a rather rude message:\n\nThank you for hosting me. I wish I could say I had a great stay, but to be honest with you now, it was ruined when you angrily (and hypocritically) gave me unsolicited advice on training my dog. Also, your many comments demonizing her and making a big fuss every time we stepped outside made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in your home. I'm glad you changed your listing to no pets because you're obviously not very good with them. I suggest you take your own advice in controlling your dog's incessant barking; maybe read up on that \"Dachshunds for Dummies.\"\n\nI later received a message from Airbnb telling me that my account received a warning and to make sure my pet does not present a risk. Furious, I called Airbnb support and filed a similar complaint about the owner's dog.\n\nNow months after the fact, I somewhat regret my pettiness. My dog's reactivity has gotten worse since then and sometimes I feel maybe the owner was right in some ways and I also could have been more upfront. We understand her reactivity more now (shoutout to r/reactivedogs) and have been working hard to train her, more methodically than we had been at the time of the incident.

When the meals came, there must have been a mix up because she got the beef dish that I ordered while I got a vegan dish that she must have ordered. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t mind. Before I could eat it though, she came over and asked if we could switch meals. She didn\u2019t touch the beef dish either.\n\nI said no, I didn\u2019t feel like switching because the vegan dish actually looks a lot better than the beef one. She asked if I was serious. I said yeah, sorry, I don\u2019t want to switch. I suggested she go approach the kitchen for another plate.\n\nHowever as it turns out, only 9 guests in total ordered the vegan option and the caterer ran out of the main course. So unfortunately she just ended up eating some ice berg lettuce with a few pieces of tomato and cucumbers but no dressing because it\u2019s not vegan. \n\nMy friend thought I was justified, but later my ex-BF came over to me and called me a \u201cbitter loser\u201d and told me to grow up.\n\nAITA ?

My boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated Arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time.

Over the last year I've fought through a fairly high conflict divorce and custody fight. The process was ugly but custody and placement is shared 50/50. The court orders require that expenses related to the child are to be split 50/50. Expenses greater than $100 must have the consent of both parties before being undertaken otherwise it becomes the sole responsibility of the purchasing parent.  \n\nI live in an area known for long and cold winter weather. Approximately a month and a half ago I approached my ex about setting up our child with winter clothing while it was readily available. They hemmed and hawwed and eventually came up with a hand me down coat that was already a size too small. It is usable now but will not last the winter.  We were still without boots, mittens,  and snow pants.  \n\nWithin the last week temperatures have dropped sharply and we've received our first snows. It could not be put off any longer so I purchased the needed clothing. Hat, mittens, properly fitting coat, boots and snow pants.  The total expense was under $100.  When I presented the receipts to my ex, the refused to pay for their half of the expenses, citing a lack of funds. I am not insensitive to that,  and suggested that they pay me back over the winter as they're able. They refused, stating they didn't have the money and it didn't matter if they paid me or not- the clothes were already purchased. \n\nI was put off by this- the tone and tenor of the conversation was very much along the lines of \"what will you do about it? Let the child without on my weeks?\" I was further put off because difficult winters are no surprise here, and despite the proclamations of no money, my ex smokes nearly a pack of cigarettes a day and routinely posts about frequent nights out at bars on social media. I don't want to police their spending but claiming no money for necessary childhood expenses while spending heavily on vices sits badly with me. \n\nThe small coat my ex got their hands on will be sufficient for weekly exchanges and trips to the store- little else. It would truly be a barest of minimums until the child grows out of it. Family and friends are suggesting I keep my proper winter clothes for myself for use during my placement weeks while leaving the option open to pay half and fully share when and if me ex comes to their senses.

Now, I'm not judging her for that considering I also come from a semi-similar, just not as strict, background. \n\nThe stituation: \n\nDuring the summer, she asked me if she could use my Netflix account. I said yes, of course, and had to increase the subscription to the 2 screens at a time, just in case we were watching it at the same time. She offered to venmo me half of the subscription every month, but she never did and I never asked because it was automatic billing and I never checked my account to see when the money was coming out of it. \n\nA few months after her, another friend (who she doesnt know that well) asked for my subscription and so I had to increase to the 2-4 screens tier. They actually paid me at the beginning of each month, but like I said, I never checked my account (they have the same bank as me) so the money would go in and I wouldn't notice.\n\nFast forward to last month, I lost my wallet and obviously cancelled my card. This apparently occurred before Netflix was due and they asked her to update the billing info when she signed on one day. She offered to add her card, since I hadn't gotten my new one yet.\n\nNetflix recently increased their pricing, so instead of $13.99, the subscription that we have is now $15.99. Today, she texted me asking if we could downgrade to the $8.99 plan. I told her not really, since there were 3 people on the plan and it wouldn't make sense for us to essentially have to police each other's Netflix times. She then tried to argue that we most likely won't be watching Netflix at the same time, because she barely watches it. I already know this to be a lie, since she practically uses it everyday.\n\nI told her that I would just switch it back to my card instead. She still insisted on switching it, even though she hasn't paid me a cent from the previous months, so it wouldn't be like she would pay me when I switched it back. So I told her I would just get my own account and keep it simple. I honestly only said that because I knew that she wouldn't protest because that would mean her having to pay $8.99 herself, if she still wanted the service. I knew it was manipulatory, but I was honestly annoyed that she was mincing over a $2.00  difference because it just happened to be on her card for a single month, but when I was paying the $13.99/month subscription, she didn't offer or even cared that I was paying that much.\n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I\u2019ll also try to add a lot of details because my family is pretty split with this situation and we don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\nMy wife right now is currently 24.

But most likely one. We talked about it and decided to adopt a baby in the future for two reasons. One, we want to give a  baby a new home, and two, my wife has some fertility issues that won\u2019t make producing a child impossible, but very difficult.\n\n\nI\u2019d like to point out that we were not planning on adopting a baby now, or in the near near future. We don\u2019t feel financially stable enough and we still want time with each other without a kid for a little while longer.

She wasn\u2019t expected to pass really soon, but we have been advised to get all of her stuff in order, just in case worse comes to worse. One issue that we\u2019re having is that my MIL wants us to adopt my wife\u2019s little sister when she passes. She believes that we are the best do to it because the girl\u2019s father has already passed, our immediate family is either too old (like in their 40s and don\u2019t want to \u201cstart over\u201d raising a child), or simply not able to raise a child, we are supposedly around the perfect age to bring in a child, and we were already planning on adopting.\n\n\nMy wife and I thought about it for a long time and came to the conclusion that we didn\u2019t feel ready to adopt her little sister. Unfortunately, my MIL\u2019s condition was starting to worsen a little bit quicker than we expected, so the issue was becoming more urgent. When we told her that we didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking on that job right now, she started crying and calling us names. She also said something along the lines of \u201chow dare you live your perfect life with your husband while your little sister, your own flesh and blood could end up in the system\u201d to my wife. This really upset her and I had to calm her down when we got off the phone.\n\n\nWe would be fine with keeping her for a little while, but we just don\u2019t simply feel ready to have a new teenager in the household.\n\n\nOther family members have heard about the situation and some are calling us selfish for not being willing to struggle to keep somebody in the family, and some can see our side.

It\u2019s going to be the biggest, happiest and arguably most important day of my life. My soon wife-to-be is a foreigner and for the sake of her family (since getting a visa to come to the US is super hard and expensive from where she is from), we have decided to make it a destination wedding and get married where she is from. Growing up, there is a friend of mine, call him X, who is the son of one of my mom\u2019s friend. He was definitely my best friend growing up. When I graduated, which was 7-8 years ago, that\u2019s when we started hanging out less due to work and just life in general. So what I tend to do nowadays is host a guy\u2019s day where a handful of the guys closest to me are invited to my home to play video and board games, drink beer, talk, catch up and generally hangout. So I send out the wedding invites, I was never in a gang before but I\u2019d imagine this would be the closest I\u2019d ever get to giving an \u201cOG call\u201d. All of my groomsmen respond yes except for X...even the ones that live out of state, then I get the phone call. He hits me with, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but I can\u2019t make it to your wedding. It catches me totally off guard. I stumble for words and ask is this because of the cost? Because if it is, I tell him not to worry about it, I can cover for him, flight, hotel, you name it. Then he tells me, no, the reason he can\u2019t come is because his mom and girlfriend don\u2019t want him to. I try to understand why they say that and X says that he is very sorry but because the wedding is abroad, his mom thinks the destination itself is dangerous, even though we are at a five star (think Four Seasons) resort. He continues to say he\u2019s sorry and the reason why he hasn\u2019t told me sooner is because he was conflicted and his mom and girlfriend have been telling him to make this call to me for weeks so he can \u201cget over with it\u201d. Then he tells me that if only the wedding was held locally, basically where we live now, he would make it in a heartbeat. Now, for a bit of background, X\u2019s mom has been going through a tough time, health wise, so I\u2019m not one to make things worse by causing tension between X and his mom, so when he says because mom, it sounds like an excuse that I can say anything against. I thank him for letting me know early and don\u2019t feel like making excuses for him to come and hang up. I spend the next hour after that just processing what I just heard and trying to force back tears. My mouth becomes dry, it\u2019s definitely one of the most disappointing news I\u2019ve ever received. For the next few days after that, I\u2019m trying to rethink my friendship with X. If it was the other way around and X was getting married in Kalamazoo, I\u2019d become Dora the effin explorer to get there. It just hurts so much.

The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend.

She had told me a few times she was planning on going and visiting a friend she had made in her sorority like group who we will call E which she actually did so my suspicion lessened over a month or so and everything seemed very normal and happy.

No big deal. Well when she let me add her phone I couldn't help but notice she had fucking tinder downloaded dead center of a bunch of other apps on her phone. So it was very obvious she wasn't trying to hide anything. And since that rose my suspicion higher than it's ever been, she had left her phone in the bathroom when I went to take a shower this morning and we are very open and neither one of us get mad if the other needs to use the others phone for texting and calling people. So I locked the door and went through her texts and found that not only had she been texting her friend J for around 5 months as far as I could tell.

We offered to help her move, but she said her new law firm paid for her movers. We made plans to go see her the first week she was here, but when we showed up, she seemed very unenthusiastic and just didn't want to hang out with us.  Wendy messaged her that night just asking if things were ok, and got this response:\n\"Hey it was great seeing you too.  Sorry if I was upset.

Wendy was immediately worried, and texted back saying, \"if you're traumatized, you shouldn't be alone.  I'll come and hang out with you.\" To which Francie responded, \"Please don't.\" \n\nWe were pretty shocked, but didn't say anything.  Since then, Francie has seen Wendy max once a week.

Unfortunately for me, after asking out 4 different groups of friends and my girlfriend (24F let's call her Joy), everyone is a lot more interested in Endgame.

The following started last weekend and the \"date\" is supposed to be tomorrow (24/05)\n\nAfter a bit of pestering and getting an adamant no from Joy, I jokingly told her \"Fine, I'll just go on Tinder\" only to get a \"Hah, like that'll work out\".

Throughout the entire time, I thought Joy was ok with it. She joked about how I'll end up watching the movie alone once I told Jenny.

Given this statament, \"AITA for calling the police on a party? | Throwaway because I dont want it linked to my main. Also on mobile so sorry for formatting issues. \n\nBackground: My girlfriend (25F) and I (27M) have been together for a little over 9 months. She is black. I am white. \n\nYesterday, I was spending the night at my girlfriend's place. She lives in a duplex and has lived beside the same neighbors for two years. They aren't friends but are friendly. \n\nThe neighbors had people over and were playing loud music and we could hear them. It wasn't a huge issue but it went on past 10pm. I told my girlfriend that I was going to talk to them but she told me not to because they had actually come to her a few days before to ask if it would be alright for them to host a birthday party at their house, knowing it would go late and she'd be able to hear it because of how thin the walls are. GF is a hard sleeper when it comes to sound so the noise wasn't really bothering her. I'm a light sleeper. She forgot about the party when we discussed me sleeping over. \n\nShe told me she wouldn't be upset if I chose to go home but it was late and I didnt want to drive. I told her I was going over to speak with them. She decided to go herself. She comes back and they turn the volume on the music down and quiet down to a respectable level. \n\nMidnight rolls around and they volume has slowly risen back to it's original volume (the music stayed low but I could hear their conversation). GF doesn't wake up so I decide to call the police since they'd been warned. They show up about a half hour later. The flashing lights of the police car through the windows wakes up girlfriend.\n\nShe asks if I called the police and I confirm that I did. She gets incredibly angry and tells me that as soon as the officer leaves, I need to get out of her house. I ask her why and she tells me that she and I have had the discussion before that she doesn't believe in calling the police on other black people if no one is in danger and that, as a guest in her home, I should have respected that. She was also angry because she says I had the opportunity to go back to my own place earlier in the night when it was apparent the noise level that they had already cleared with her, was going to disturb my sleep. \n\nI told her I would leave but that she was being ridiculous and that if her neighbors couldn't be quiet after she asked them to then the next logical step was to get the police involved. \n\nShe refused to have any further discussion with me and, once the police left after making everyone who didnt live in the other side of the duplex leave, she made me leave around 2am even though she knew I had work this morning. \n\nI've tried calling and texting her but the only response I got was a text telling me that she needed to evaluate if she could trust me to take issues in her community seriously and she needed some space to do it.\n\nI still think I was right and it was inconsiderate of her to make me drive back to my own place so late. \nSo, AITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

We\u2019ve started planning our wedding and have run into a big problem: \n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents, brother and sister-in-law, and nieces and nephew have been planning a family trip to the US for a long time, and they\u2019ve already booked their flights to California next August. Their plan is to stay with us for a little over a week and then spend another week and a half on a road trip across the Southwest (Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, etc.) before flying out of Dallas.\n\nMy sister Jess is also getting married in August, and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family already knows we won\u2019t be available that weekend and have timed their road trip to start a few days before the wedding. However, they will be in our city the weekend before that.\n\nI asked my fianc\u00e9 if there\u2019s any way his family would be able to fly to the US twice in one year, and he said no. because round-trip flights from Australia are really expensive. We would have to push the wedding back another year minimum for them to be able to make it out here again, which we don\u2019t want to do. My fianc\u00e9 says he\u2019s okay with his extended family not being able to make it, but it\u2019s really important to him for his parents and brother to be there. After a lot of conversation, we decided to go ahead and set our date for the weekend his family will be in town. I sent an email to my parents, grandparents and Jess last night, explaining our decision. \n\nWell, Jess left me a really upset voicemail this morning, saying our aunts/uncles/cousins aren\u2019t going to be able to afford to travel across the country for two weddings a week apart. She thinks they\u2019ll just go to mine because it\u2019s first and skip hers. \n\nI feel really bad about the timing, but we didn\u2019t choose the date with any malicious intent.

The high schoolers she works with don't like their manager, he keeps their hours just below the threshold for higher pay, doesn't give promised raises, and is just an asshole to work with.\n\nRecently my daughter and one of her friends were joking about making a union like the ones they were studying at school. They texted some of the other kids from work, and the idea started gaining traction. So I talked with them about it, explaining the possible benefits and risks. I tried to encourage them to do their own research too. I thought it was pretty cool that they were considering taking something they're learning about in history class and applying it.\n\nThe girls ended up inviting the other high school kids who worked at the coffee shop to our house, to talk about how to unionize. I could tell some kids were going along for fun. But most of them were taking it seriously. I helped them write out their demands and practice them. They even got the college kids, who were unhappy with scheduling around exams, on board. \n\nThey all went to the coffeeshop Sunday morning, and presented their case to the boss. Who absolutely blew up on them, and told them that if they didn't stick to their schedule, they were all fired. But the kids stood their ground. He started singing out the kids that were scheduled to work that morning and telling them to start work immediately or they're fired. And so three of them got fired. Then he told the rest that anyone else who didn't report for their shifts would be fired too, and I don't think he expected them to call his bluff. He fired several more, then started demanding that the \"fired\" kids come in to work. Right now, the kids are all holding strong. Apparently the manager is trying to replace everyone fast, but isn't having much luck. \n\nI'm honestly quite proud of my daughter for all this. But the parents of the other high school kids aren't all OK with this. Several of them have called me up or come to speak to me furious with me for these reasons:\n- Making their kid lose their job, which they were supposed to keep to teach them hard work and responsibility\n- Encouraging kids to be entitled brats and sabatoge a local business owner\n- Letting the kids play at something they didn't really understand\n\nI told them that the kids made their choice, all I did was give them a place to talk and plan things. I got a call from the coffeeshop owner too, to say that my daughter hasn't been covering her shifts. And that the kids are \"playing\" at a union. I told him that it doesn't sound like play to me, perhaps he should listen to what they have to say.

I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg.

Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that.

You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help?

I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that.

The discussion came around to my wife and I and how long we've been together and someone noticed I wasn't in photos that I should have been and asked about it and my MIL went silent. \n\nSee, I wasn't included in these portraits for a number of years because \"only family\" could be in the photos. Since my wife and i were \"only dating\", they felt I shouldn't be in the portraits because it \"probably wouldn't work out.\"\n\nMy wife and I met in college and dated thru school and had a relatively long engagement as we got on our feet so we were together almost 7 years before our wedding. Despite all our time together, and my wife begging each year, my MIL and SILs insisted that I shouldn't be in the portraits until we said our vows, even the fucking year before our wedding despite the date set and save-the-dates sent. And honestly, it always hurt and was like a yearly reminder that I wasn't truly \"family\" to them. \n\nThe real kicker to me though is that my MIL and SILs were all married and since divorced in that time, one of my SIL twice! So all these photos that I wasn't worthy to be part of include men that are not only *not* a part of the family anymore, but 2 were really assholes and all three of my SILs marriages were short-lived relationships and ended in messy divorces on really bad terms. But me, who is still here and the other half of the only long lasting and successful relationship of my wife's immediate family, was not included in this tradition for nearly a decade. \n\nSo anyway, I started laughing when the question came up and went over the story and pointed out how all these jerks are in the photos but I wasn't allowed. And I apparently took a bit of joy in the fact that since my MIL and SILs pretty much hate those men now, the portraits are kind of useless and stay locked in a cabinet all year because of it. (It used to practically be a coffee table book) \n\nWell, my MIL started crying, my SILs were offended at my portrayals of their marriages, and everyone else who didn't see the humor was pretty much upset at me for calling them out for their unfair practices. \n\nI felt like I acted fairly at the time by just pointing out how the tradition backfired but my wife mentioned that I still get pissy each year over the photos and always have something snarky to say and it's long past time I let it go.

He runs internal diagnostics to determine the damage. No one here is a doctor, but Pumpkin and I have had serious running injuries. After a while Bill is able to stand, put weight on his injured foot, and limp. His run is clearly done.\n\nHere's where I think ITA. We determine Bill can walk back to the trailhead.

It was a seafood dish that I had never tried before, but when all the food came, I ate about half of it but it was upsetting my stomach. \n\nMy girlfriend noticed and asked if it was alright, I told her I couldn't eat it anymore and I said I will probably order something else.

Since I wasn't on the hook for paying, I wanted to splurge and ordered some dessert (I was the only one).\n\nAfter finishing, the check came and as we were all getting up, the father came to me and told me I owed him for the extra bottle of wine. I was surprised and told him I thought he was only joking, he said he wasn't. I told him \"you said at the beginning everything was on you, now you're suddenly making me pay?\" \n\nHe argued with me and said the whole extra bottle and dinner was unnecessary. He and his wife have well paying jobs so I said to him \"well what difference does it make? You can obviously afford it\" \n\nEventually he got frustrated and just dropped it.

I'm based in San Jose, CA. Recently we wrapped up a huge project for a company in NYC and they flew us out for a week to install the software at their HQ and make sure everything was working smoothly. The first night they took us out to a very fancy steak restaurant and treated us to dinner. I should mention that there were 3 representatives from their company as well as 4 people from my company, including myself and my boss.\n\nDuring the dinner, I did not eat anything. I simply ordered several sparkling waters and sipped them the entire night.

It ended up that this business trip was during the week I was supposed to do this.\n\nAnyway, I felt that during the entire time both my coworkers and the company representatives were very uncomfortable that I was not eating anything. Since I don't like to tell people that I fast every two months, I just say that I am not interested in eating right now or I am not hungry. People have tried to lecture me how it is extremely unhealthy to fast in the past and it's just easier for me to avoid the conversation.\n\nAnyway, after the dinner my boss called me when I was back at the hotel and he told me that it was extremely disrespectful that I did not eat anything the entire time. He said it made the company look bad and that he had never been so embarrassed in his life. He said that he will discuss it with the director of engineering when we get back to the office next week and that he will need to speak with me in person about my inappropriate actions.\n\nTo be honest, I do not feel like I was the asshole in this situation, but I also am not known for knowing social cues all too well.

Her daughter Nicole is two years older than my son Jack. \n\nJack did fairly well in school but not amazingly. He was always well behaved and was never in any trouble. Unfortunately not long after leaving school a friend of his (NOT Jack himself) got involved in something very serious, and Jack agreed to help. The result was both Jack and his friend being arrested and sent to prison. They both served over two years but are out now. \n\nJack accepts that what happened was nobody's fault but his own. He's never tried to blame me or my husband for it and has taken responsibility. He has made efforts to get himself into work including getting himself professional qualifications for construction and maintenance work. Unfortunately Jack's conviction (possession of a firearm) is treated as extremely serious in the UK and as a result most companies won't even consider him, and the only employment he can get is for temporary agencies, which is OK, but it means he can spend days or even weeks out of work at times. He is constantly sending out job applications but either hearing nothing or getting rejected. \n\nNicole is the total opposite. Very clever, academically gifted, pretty and successful. She's a corporate lawyer, and Ruth is always going on about how proud she is which she has the right to do. \n\nWhen Nicole was a teenager Ruth used to tell me about how her and her husband Owen were called into the school because Nicole had been bullying other girls. She didn't think much of it and thought it was harmless and nothing serious, but it was serious enough that they had to fight to stop her being expelled at least once, and Ruth still insisted that Nicole was not in the wrong. \n\nThe reason I say this is that when I mention that Jack is currently out of work and how difficult he's finding it, Ruth shows no sympathy. She says that he made his bed and she doesn't feel sorry for him. She also called us bad parents who raised a criminal. I was fuming and shouted over the phone that Nicole wouldn't be where she was if they hadn't gone out of their way to protect her from the consequences. Ruth became very angry and said that you can't compare ''harmless teasing'' to what Jack did. \n\nI told Ruth that she was the bad parent. Jack faced the consequences for his actions and is making every effort to do better. I also told her Nicole didn't earn her success since she wouldn't have managed it if the school had succeeded in kicking her out. Ruth slammed the phone down, and when I told my hubby he thought while I had a point, it was better left unsaid. I disagree.

She has a 12 year old daughter from a previous relationship (lived together 2 years). Wedding booked in with deposit for 2021. Just started her 3rd year of Uni.\n\nSituation: In order to make us moving in together work, she got a part time job. We both contribute 100% of our finances. We are comfortable enough with the money we have to be able to have family vacations, run 2 decent cars, rent our house, never want for anything etc.\n\nShe has always insisted on working part time since we moved in together, but has always complained about her job, regardless of what it is (through 3 different ones). After her first proper shift in this 3rd job, she complained louder than ever, almost in tears when talking about it. I told her to quit now and look for another job, it wasn't worth ruining her dissertation year over. \n\nOver this period of complaining, she kept repeating to me \"I'm not a lazy person, I don't want to not-work, it's just this job.\" and \"I used to work full time and be a single mother, I'm a hard worker\".\n\nShe did, and she has offers of a couple of jobs now, but h has now started dragging her feet about getting started with these new jobs, as well as saying that she has been talking to some friends and that they think she shouldn't have to work, I should just be happy she is contributing her student finance to our outgoings.\n\nShe has also started saying that she is considering doing her Masters. Then her PGCE (teaching qualification).\n\nI am starting to get big \"I don't want to work\" vibes in general, which will definitely impact our future plans. Wedding, having a kid , buying a house. I am not down for having a child out of wed-lock and as I say we are both in our 30's, so it's not like we have an indefinite amount of time to do that.\n\nNow, I've never thrown my income in her face and dismiss the disparity if she raises it, but I used to have ~\u00a31500 disposable income before we moved in together, I now have none. I'm now getting concerned that she is more interested in extending the length of time that she doesn't have to work, rather than building our life together that we have had planned.\n\nWhenever we talk about it (it keeps coming back up), I say the same. Working part time and being at university is not impossible (her brother did it, my sister did it, one of my best friends worked full time while at Uni). That yes, we could get by without her wage, but things would be tighter and may impact our wedding/future plans. Especially if she is planning on doing her masters and putting off getting into work by another year, which definitely would put a spanner in our plans and we would have to reconsider buying a house and having a child. If she needs more time, that she should try cutting down on things like reading facebook or watching TV alone in the middle of the day rather than dropping work.

I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her\u2019s.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  \n\nPretty much since my son was born I\u2019ve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I\u2019ve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I\u2019m proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I\u2019ve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  \n\nMy girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we\u2019ve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn\u2019t want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. \n\nWe are a great team usually.

In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don\u2019t particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. \n\nNeither of us have been backing down and it won\u2019t be too much longer until it\u2019s time to give him the money.  \", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My mom also says our family is overpaying (a few other families in the neighborhood hire the same cleaning ladies, and we're paying more than they are).\n\nThe thing is, my mom's a very timid person.

For example, she wants them to clean up the sinks and all that well, but they don't.

She is also extremely little for her age. She is very petite and short. She was not premature, that's just how some women in my family are.

He is older than her by 2 years. He will push her over which is very easy due to her size, she often comes home with bruises on her legs and arms from him. He calls her names like midget and baby. She is rather sensitive and is very upset by this. They have swimming lessons at school and last week he flushed her swimming goggles down the boys toilet. \n\nI informed the school that I was unhappy with what had been taking place, and asked for the boys parents to replace the goggles.

He then went on to say that appropriate kids presents are not books. \n\nI didn't bother to reply, but now I'm wondering if my gifts actually are bad. I just know that my dash cam gives me a sense of peace when driving, and I know they have saved a lot of people in insurance battles. \n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Hear me out.\n\nI am an only child and my parents both worked full time jobs for most of my life. I had to pretty much raise myself. I had to get myself ready for school, make my own lunches and often my own dinners as both my parents worked a lot of overtime. Regardless of my struggles I was able to overcome it and become a quality member of society. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in acting. Which I am still working on to this day. I work full time as an electrician and since I live in LA I barely make it. All I can afford is a crappy studio apartment but that\u2019s ok I\u2019m happy with my life because I am going to be a successful actor one day and money won\u2019t mean anything to me.\n\nAnyways I left home a while ago and don\u2019t see my parents too often, we talk occasionally on the phone but other than that we don\u2019t really communicate. The other day I was visiting them and my mother informed me that both she and my father were going to be retiring within the next year and then they would be renting the house out while they traveled around the world. That got us to talking about the house more and my mother said that after they traveled for a while they were gonna likely sell the house and buy property somewhere in Italy or Spain and retire comfortably by some beach. \n\nI then said \u201cwhat about me\u201d and my mother says \u201cwhat about you?\u201d Aren\u2019t I going to get anything from you guys? The house was supposed to go to me when you guys died.\u201d My mother chucked and said \u201cwhy would we give you the house? You never put any work or money into it. Your father asked for your help on the garage and you said no. So why would we leave the house to you?\u201d I was shocked she was saying this to me. And I go \u201cwell because that\u2019s your obligation. It\u2019s what parents do. You guys own that house. Are you at least going to give me any money when you sell it?\u201d Again my mother laughed and said \u201cof course not, you\u2019re gonna be an actor right? You\u2019re gonna have your own money why do you need ours. Besides we will need it to buy property abroad.\u201d \n\nI stood there shocked and said \u201cwhat am I gonna with property abroad when you guys die?\u201d My mother then says we won\u2019t be leaving it to you, in our wills that property will go to some charities\u201d.\n\nAt that point I turned around and just walked away.

My girlfriend has pretty bad anxiety so wouldn't have the confidence to say anything to him. I saw her look behind her and panic a little so I made eye contact with her.

She was pissed. She says I should've stood my ground, but I didn't want to annoy that guy or the staff member.

I am usually a 15% tipper.  If service is poor, it's less and if service is great, then the tip is more.  I was not overly thrilled about her service but I thought I would still leave a $5.25 as the tip, which is slightly above the 15%.

I then asked my colleague, \"Is she expecting a $10.00 tip for that service?\" I felt incredibly insulted that she would bring the change back in that manner. I thought there is no way that she doesn't understand that the change she brings me is where her tip is going to come from. It clearly felt to me that this was her hustle.  She figured that I would either leave her the $10.00 tip. So, instead of leaving her the $10.00 tip she had hoped for, I left her $0.25.

I (28M) really don't feel like an asshole but I have nothing to base that on.\n\nI was at a buddies bachelor party weekend in Denver, CO. Saturday night rolls around and \\~1-2am a group of us decide to go to a strip club. I had never been to one before and wanted to check it out. About 6 of us head on in and quickly hit up the bar after giving the place a once over. Pretty quickly a couple of the guys found a girl to give the bachelor a private dance. The two of them head off to the back while the rest of us start hanging out around the stage.\n\nAt this point I am just hanging out and enjoying the show. A few girls come on and off the stage and I was even throwing some money around (really not much). Eventually I am standing up near the stage and a girl comes up to me and says \"I have been looking all over for you!\". Now, I know this girl wasn't looking anywhere for me, it felt like a panhandler throwing a routine at me. Not really knowing what else to do I just tell her \"No thanks\" thinking she'd leave me alone. I really didn't want any private attention and was thinking our group would be heading out anytime as soon as the bachelor was done with his dance.\n\nHer response to this was \"Why would you say 'no thanks' when I haven't offered you anything?\". I tried to explain that I am just here for a buddies bachelor party and just wasn't interested in anything. Keep in mind the club was extremely loud and it was very difficult to hear anything. Throughout our entire exchange there were a lot of \"WHATS?\" going back and forth. After this she says to me in a very offended tone of voice \"You come across as kind of a dick\".  Really not knowing what to do or why a stripper is mad at me I just start apologizing and try to tell her again that I am just here to support a friend and wasn't interested in a private dance. Again she tells me, getting more and more aggressive that she hadn't offered me a dance and it was extremely rude to assume that she would.\n\nAt this point I literally put my hands up in surrender, apologize again, and tell her this is the first time I have ever been to a strip club. I really didn't know what to expect. Again she it literally scolding me and tells me to not be such an asshole next time. I just leave my hands up in surrender as she walks away to another dude.\n\nWas I really such a big asshole or was she having a rough day and wanted to take it out on me?

Some history about me, I have had some very poor relationships and I know I am not the perfect guy, however I am 'too nice' sometimes which makes people walk all over me. I had a job where I didnt require a place to live due to excessive travel. It was a wonderful job and I unfortunately got let go. This amazing woman let me move in with her and her family and she has really been there for me when times are tough. I had enough money to get my life back on track and within one month of living at her parents with her I got a car, job and an apartment. I got the apartment in my name because i have been through a relationship before where things ended up not working out and I was screwed. I guess you learn from your previous relationships. She helped me move into my new apartment along with helping me buy new furniture and she came with me to purchase my new car. She has really been there for me. She immediately moved in with me and I could tell after a month she wasnt that comfortable. Maybe it was because of the drastic change from her parents? or maybe it was because we moved towards the big city? I still will never know but I could tell she was very uncomfortable. \n\nMy wake up costs are nearly $3000 dollars. Yes i know this sounds like a lot but my new job was paying well. Rent $1650, Car $400 with insurance, Phone bill, other bills, student loan. Yes it comes close to about $3000 dollars. Insane right?\n\nWell fast forward 5 months later, I asked her to help me out with rent even if she could pay me $500 and possibly groceries. anything as this point because it is very expensive for me to be paying for both of us. She works full time 40 hour weeks. She makes about $3000-$4000 per month before taxes. She would never help me out!\n\nIts getting to a point where I am coming off as a dick now because she is not helping me pay the bills at all, and i keep confronting her. Her excuses make me even more upset like how she said she pays her sisters gym pass and she doesnt even go. how does this effect me or even us? One of my friends asked if she splits the rent (idk why he asked but i was standing right there) She blatantly lied and said yes she helps a lot. I confronted her about this, she still just plays completely dumb about it and tells me she has no money and comes up with excuses where her money goes. \n\nI cant keep doing this. I told her 'love' isnt enough to keep this together if she wants to be in a relationship it needs to be made together it feels very one sided right now....

I am the only Vegan. I don't preach or try to convert pothers, it's my choice, and my business. Plus I live in a rural farming community and Veganism is viewed in general with mild suspicion, hostility or ridicule.\n\nAnyway, I can't afford to attend the staff Christmas meal this year. (I'm a single parent saving for a mortgage). \n\nTo reassure a concerned work colleague, I explained that aside from financial constraints, the thought of being at a table of people eating meat made me feel very uncomfortable. So it really wasn't a big deal for me to miss it and she shouldn't feel bad.\n\nAs well as the annual Christmas meal, we also have a staff Christmas lunch the day before, low key, held in the office, we all bring our own food. A different work colleague sent an email out this week requesting that every one bring a Vegan dish this year. \n\nI felt surprised about this and confused, so asked why this was. The colleague advised that I speak to the person I had confided in, who responded by looking down and not saying anything (sort of in a joking way, but they still wouldn't speak to me, they can be a bit strange sometimes). \n\nPlease bare in mind that Veganism is often a deeply personal choice. It is also difficult to get Vegan food, and is an acquired taste. I'm not going to lie here, some of it is overpriced and grim, \\[if you dont know brands to avoid and cost effective alternatives\\].\n\nWith this in mind, I sent a borderline pleading email out to everyone, thanking them for being thoughtful. I was honest and said that I felt uncomfortable as it seemed restrictive, and it would be better if everyone just brought what they wanted to.\n\nI received an email response refusing my request stating that people 'didn't mind trying Vegan' and 'we are ganging up on you lol'. (I dont think this was meant in a horrible way, but I felt frustrated that I had been ignored).\n\nI spoke to another work college and explained how uncomfortable this was making me and how the Christmas lunch shouldn't be about my Veganism. I also shared how I envisioned people gagging at the food or opening up awkward conversations about Veganism as a lifestyle choice.  \n\nMy work colleague was really nice and sent an email saying she would be bringing a meat dish and that the lunch shouldn't be themed and there shouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe manager then responded by email that she would be bringing Vegan dish. Now I keep getting asked by (mildly panicked) colleagues how to make Vegan dishes.\n\nI'm aware that I probably sound really precious and sensitive and projecting a 'my culture isnt your prom dress' vibe.

Today no residents (we think, whew, this mtg will go FAST!). Except, T says, I have an Open Forum item. He says, it's about chrissy0116. She lets her dog out into the open area in back of TH not on a leash. And her son does too in front. That's against the rules. I reply, T, you know we stand at the back door, and son does too, right? He says, yes, but it is still against the rules. I just say, OK, noted. After adjournment, I turn to T and loudly say, I am extremely upset and angry that you called me out in a public forum over something so trivial. Had there been anyone in the audience, I would have left and resigned the board immediately. He said, well, it is a public forum issue and that would have been your prerogative to do so. I left and got more and more angry. This is a 14YO basset hound with one foot in the grave, who slithers himself off the porch, sniffs around the grassy area for 2-3 minutes and then hauls his old butt up the porch and back inside. We stand there and watch him in case he wanders off. Son lets him walk up and down the grass next to the house while he smokes, and then brings him inside.\n\nAfter awhile, I called Pres and said I would finish my term out of professionalism and not to put Pres in a bad situation (1 F board member is leaving at EOM and another is an a cardiac rehab facility til ??).

She was excited, the only problem was I hadn't worked out how we were going to pay for it. \n\nWe have joint accounts, and budget our money together including some 'splurge' for each of us to spend how we want. The cost of the dinner was going to be more than what I could cover with my splurge alone, so I suggested we maybe go halves or something. This upset her because she believed as I was taking her to dinner I should pay. I didn't press the issue then because I didn't know what to do.\n\nLater that day we were out having lunch. Knowing I wouldn't be able to use my splurge for the lunch and the dinner, I said \"if you pay for lunch, I'll sort out the dinner.\" She agreed and we had lunch. I thought I'd pay for the dinner with the credit card and sort it out later.\n\nWell looking at our budget later I realized that as I stroke of luck, due to the fact we pay our loans monthly and budget half the repayment every fortnight, there are actually 3 pays before the next loan repayment. Excellent, I can use some of that money to pay for the dinner. The rest can just go onto the loans as an extra payment.\n\nWe went to dinner a few days later, had a great time, all was good.

(I have since put all my splurge back onto the credit card to cover most of the dinner payment). She got very angry at me for making her pay for the dinner without her consent, and is saying that I'm sneaky for getting a free lunch and not paying for her dinner etc. I don't think there's anything wrong with using our money to pay for our dinner, but believes now that the romantic dinner doesn't really count as me doing something nice for her because I paid for it out of our joint money. \n\nSo AITA for using the extra loan payments?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

It was my grandma\u2019s 80th birthday yesterday so many of my relatives gathered at my mom\u2019s house to celebrate the occasion. I (23M) was at my mom\u2019s house all day to hang out with my brother (18M). My mom told me to buy pizzas for everyone for when they\u2019ll arrive in the evening. I bought 5 large Round Table pizzas, 1 vegetarian for the 2 pescatarians in the family and 4 supremes, of which one was cheese-less for my lactose intolerant brother. \n\n\nMy uncle, 2 aunts, and 4 cousins came over, of which one of them, Marika (20F), would be at odds with me later. I don\u2019t follow her life closely. The last time I saw her was over half a year ago. She was always fairly skinny, but not deathly skinny. I\u2019d say she was always around 5\u20196\u201d 115 lbs and ate a normal amount of food, including meat. This time she looked very emaciated and looks to only weigh around 105 lbs give or take. The only meat on her bones are her fake boobs that weren\u2019t there the last time I saw her. She doesn\u2019t look like the fit-skinny type of girl you see at the gym. She looks like she can\u2019t even cradle 5 boxes of pizza. \n\n\nI know better than to give unprovoked negative comments. However, while we were all in the backyard eating pizza, Marika was the only one who wasn\u2019t eating any. When my mom asked her why not, she said that she\u2019s not hungry. It seems like her parents aren\u2019t concerned about her health. No one in our family besides my grandma is fat, but no one is as skinny as Marika is now either. I\u2019m a relatively fit person at 6\u20191\u201d 180 lbs. I\u2019m slightly concerned that Marika has a possible eating disorder. \n\n\nI told her that she should have some of my brother\u2019s pizza since it doesn\u2019t have cheese so it has fewer calories. She said that she\u2019s really not hungry. I asked her what she ate for lunch. She said she had guacamole on toast for brunch. I said that doesn\u2019t sound very filling so she should have a slice of pizza. I also said that she looks to have lost a lot of weight and it concerns me. My mom and grandma said they agree and that she should eat more. Again, she said she eats a normal amount and when she\u2019s hungry. I told her that she should at least eat a slice with everyone and that a slice is only about 300 calories and a girl her size can eat 1500 calories and not gain weight. \n\n\nShe yelled at me to stop being so fucking annoying and pressuring her to eat when she just isn\u2019t hungry. I said I\u2019m just concerned for her. She said she\u2019s sick of people like me who keep making a big deal out of how she eats. Her mom apologized for her and thanked me for worrying about her health, but that Marika can handle herself well. I said that\u2019s great and that was pretty much the end of that discussion. Marika seemed kind of cranky, especially with me. She was on her phone nearly the whole time while the rest of us caught up.

A week ago, I noticed I was low on this medication and ordered another shipment. I normally pickup the package in the building management office, which I have not had trouble with in the past. Yesterday, it was announced that my college would be unexpectedly closing down for reasons that aren't allowed to be mentioned on this sub. I made arrangements to return to my hometown tomorrow afternoon. The building management office is not open on Saturdays.\n\nAfter taking todays dose, the final dose I had left, I went up to the building management office to check if they had received my package. As I arrived, I discovered that the office door was locked and there was a sign hanging on the door stating that the office was closing down in-person meetings to stop the spread of disease. Through the door window, I was able to see a management office employee sitting on a couch watching Netflix. I knocked on the window and she told me that the office was closed and that I should call the office if I needed any information.\n\nAnother management employee showed up to enter the office. I attempted to talk to her and she told me, in person, that the office was closed and they were unable to tell me anything in person. This continued for a few minutes, with me asking questions and her telling me that the office was closed and that I'd need to call for any information. I grew increasingly frustrated, both by what I felt was a needlessly obtuse conversation and the fact that, if I didn't get my package this afternoon, I would be without medication for several days while I waited for another package to arrive in my home town. I did not mention what was contained within the package, only that it was important I received it today.\n\nI lost my temper and yelled at the management woman, telling her that I didn't want to make a phone call, I wanted my fucking package. I stormed off after giving her the middle finger. In hindsight, I could have handled the situation with more civility, but I do feel that some anger was warranted due to the management woman's absolute refusal to say anything other than that I should call the office for information. Telling me to my face that she couldn't tell me things to my face felt dumb.\n\nI called the office, talked to Netflix girl, and was walked through the process of signing up to have them leave my package outside my door. I have my meds now, everything will be fine. An hour after the incident, I received a call from the woman I cursed out's supervisor asking about the situation. I explained the situation to him and told him that I had been rude, something I am sorry for. He also pointed out that the management woman was just following building policy.

I said it after she huffed and shouted \"He didn't do anything wrong!\" to my husband (her son) as he carried our son out of the room due to him throwing a huge fit in the middle of a church service.\n\nMy husband wasn't even actually disciplining him; he took him out of the room to calm him down because he was having a hard day (teething two top canines can be rough!).

My boyfriend comes over frequently and is immersed in my home life, so he is familiar with where I get my emotional tendencies from, my mother, and how important it is for my mental heath that I can vent to him.  He sees my families close relationship, and even though they can be a handful, he is always treated like an important part of the family.

I got to meet all my brother's coworkers as well as his bosses, but being much younger than most of the people there, I wasn't really involved in any conversations. I spent most of the evening just listening to everyone else around me, and what I learned is that many of my brother's fellow officers can't retell a story the same way it was told to them. Basically Person A would tell Person B a story, and when Person B went to tell the story to Person C, it was told slightly differently with changes to details. There were several instances of this happening, and this is where I'll accept being the AH, but I recorded two different conversations on my phone because I wanted to show my brother later.\n\nAnyway, toward the end of the night the Chief of Police was making his rounds at each table to talk to the guests. When he finally got to our table, he talked to my parents first and then turned to me. We made small talk, but then he asked me what I thought about following my brother's footsteps. At this point I was kind of annoyed - not with the Chief - but with my brother's coworkers not being able to retell a story right. This isn't verbatim but pretty much what I said was:\n\n\"I'm worried about the police in our town. A big part of your job is writing reports, which hold a ton of value in court and can really impact a person's life. Based on what I've seen and heard tonight though, your officers aren't capable of reporting information accurately. It makes me wonder how many police reports are incorrect and how many lives have been ruined because of it.\"\n\nTo the Chief's credit, he wasn't visibly angry or upset. He said that what I said gave him something to think about, and if I didn't mind, could I come in next Monday to talk more with him about my concerns. I'm still debating whether or not to take him up on this. Anyway, he left our table after that and I didn't interact with him anymore that night. Toward the end of the evening as everyone was getting ready to leave, my brother approached our table and told us that we were going now. He didn't even say bye to anyone and rushed us out the door. When my parents asked him what that was about, he turned on me and said I had fucked with his career. He then told my parents about what I had said to the Chief. Now my parents are angry with me and have been lecturing me (last night and this morning) about what I did.\n\nMy entire family is mad at me. My brother is calling me an entitled brat.

They took 2 hours of their own time, for 5 days a week, to stay after school and tutor me for FREE. They gave me that initial push. I studied hard most days, including during breaks.\n\nWhen I got my A-Level grades, I did amazing. I was accepted into Cambridge. I was estatic. \n\nMy Sixth Form had a ''leavers'' type assembly where we all gave awards to each other. The other classmates and teachers agreed that I was the ''Most Improved Student''. We all gave speeches after.\n\nWell when I went to accept the award, with my parents, teachers and other classmates looking at me, I said:\n\n''Thank you all for this award. It's been a crazy year, and for the most part, I thank myself. I knew what I was capable of all along...and I did this myself. I realized all along, that I was capabe of achieving something great.

You know you got a lot of help for this. Why didn't you thank them too?''. \n\nDeep down I felt a bit shit, but this was *my* moment, and I really wanted it. I told my friend that I'm leaving.

My BF (27M) doesn't really understand my passion for animals. He never grew up around them and has never had much of an interest in my pets. He likes them, but he doesn't want anymore.

Once I had gotten there, I saw I had a number of texts from my boyfriend.\n\nHe told me I was not allowed to bring the hamster home.

Our dogs, being both hounds are relatively loud, and when the beagle gets excited, she runs around in the back making this excited yelping noise usually no longer than 1-2 min. They also bark at passersby and the neighbor when she is out in her back yard (through a wooden fence). When they are barking across the fence they are wagging their tails and appear to want to play with the other dog. When my wife and I are getting home from work or leaving they get very excited and will yelp or bark a bit as we are coming up the driveway. Whenever they start to bark, we either let them inside if we are not outside or go over to them to try and quiet them. We do not leave them outside when we are not home and usually the barking is no longer than 15-30 seconds depending on the situation. On usual days they are not left outside for more than 2 hours or so at a time and we do everything we can to keep them quiet at night. The beagle can get excited when we let her out before bed, but in general after 9 or so there is no barking. We have been planted a lot of plants and made the backyard very pleasant to sit in and frequently sit back there with both of the dogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur neighbor has a dog, who is \"dog-aggressive\" and apparently frightened of other dogs as well.

We did that and it worked for all of about 1 week before they decided that wasn't enough of a deterrant and started ignoring it. My wife tries to look out our bathroom window to ensure that the neighbor isn't in her backyard before letting our dogs out.

Our weather patterns this year have been rainy, and wet overall, but we\u2019re now on a dry spell meaning work can resume.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the scoop concerning him trying to move in, whenever we had downtime, I would always offer to help. The problem is, my son wouldn\u2019t be so enthusiastic about moving (you\u2019d think they would yell \u201csee ya!\u201d After the house loan was official), he would just brush off my offers to help. \n\nWhenever I ask him if he\u2019s going to at least sleep at the new house, he just responds with \u201ci don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or he shrugs off the question. \n\nLike I said before, he didn\u2019t take advantage of the downtime due to the weather, and now it\u2019s too late for that. Work will resume, and be just as busy, I\u2019m short handed, so I can\u2019t afford workers cutting off.  \n\nRecently, my son asked if he could take time off to supervise the HVAC repair technicians, and I told him he can\u2019t, and I explained to him that we\u2019re going to be busy. Yes, he\u2019s worried that the cold will freeze the pipes, but it\u2019s going to be 60 degrees for the foreseeable future. \n\nAdditionally, he wants to move furniture like a couch, bed, and tv stand into the new house. I told him we have work, and he then started acting like he was holding a grudge against me. He claimed that moving would take less than an hour. I politely remind him that we would be way too busy with work to be doing that. \n\nHe then claims that we \u201cwon\u2019t get around to it, until work slows down, which is months away.\u201d \n\nI remind him that part of his situation was self inflicted by not capitalizing on the downtime. I then lay out his three options for getting moved in: \n\n1) wait until the weather is crappy again, and we will move furniture in then. However, I have my doubts that he\u2019s going to be enthusiastic about moving in then, if he wasn\u2019t enthusiastic the last time we had bad weather. \n\n2) move in on your own time. The problem is, that it\u2019s dark when he\u2019ll be getting around to moving in on his own time, unlikely he\u2019ll find willing friends to help unless he gives an advanced notice. \n\n3) if he\u2019s worried about \u201cmonths\u201d, then he could just rent out the property and at least make some sort of additional income, his house is in a neighborhood that has a tight housing market, everyone wants to live there. \n\nA fourth option I never mentioned was that he could just take a camping air mattress and sleeping backs up that way, but an air mattress is pretty annoying to sleep on.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

And how he was probably embarrassed and I should feel like a jerk. She went on to say how hard he was working and how she felt he was better than the freshman. I told her my job is to win games and if she is unhappy with her sons playing time, to maybe consider outside lessons.  She hung up abruptly. \n\nYesterday at practice, I gave a speech to the team about how I got a call from a parent regarding playing time. I didn\u2019t say whose parent it was, but I encouraged them to explain the nature of the team to their parents if they didn\u2019t understand. \n\nI\u2019ve also decided I\u2019m not going to give A much playing time this week, I would like to get a look at a few more freshmen in games.

During that time, my supervisor was a complete no-show. He cancelled meetings with me, delegated review of my work, and eventually moved to a different department without bothering to write an intern review. \n\nThat's where my mentor, let's call her J, came in. J was a teammate of my supervisor and voluntarily setup time to review my work, give me feedback, and even submitted a final review to management. I guess it was a good review because I got hired full time a year ago to work on the same team with J.\n\nStarting a few months back, our supervisor has been coming to work less and less. (Sounds familiar, right?) As a result, the even-higher-ups started requesting that J take over leading the team while they \"handle the situation.\" Six weeks later, our team's productivity has gone up, our whole team is happy, higher-ups are happy, and they announce that they're looking to hire someone new to run the team. \n\nI've only heard secondhand what happened next, but basically J asked if she could have the title and salary of the position since she had been doing it now for months. Higher-ups told her they would be hiring a new guy starting in March instead, but they still wanted her to stay on and run things for another  6-12 months while he got up to speed. J gave them her two week's notice on the spot, and higher ups were *livid*. Publicly livid, going so far as to call her an \"emotional woman\" and vowing to call up her new company to make sure they \"know about her insubordinate attitude\"\n\n**Here's where being a potential asshole comes in.** In our department, it's tradition to buy someone a goodbye card before they leave the company. The card is left on a table in public view for people to sign over a week or so. Nobody signed J's card. J was pretty unhappy and even *asked* me if I would go sign her card.  The thing is, she already knows how positively I feel about her mentorship and didn't see why I needed to put my name down on a goodbye card for my superiors to see. Also it seems kind of weird to me that someone would ask someone else to sign their goodbye card....But anyway, on J's last day, a higher-up personally delivered the empty card to J in front of everyone, wished her good luck, and walked off.  said her goodbyes, and I haven't been able to get in touch with her since.\n\nAITA for not signing that card?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I am aware that this is likely \u201cnot about the pizza\u201d.\nOn Black Friday last year, my boyfriend bought all new appliances for his kitchen.\nThe first time we made a frozen pizza, back in December, I followed the box directions and put the pizza directly on the rack. This resulted in cheese melting off the pizza and falling onto the bottom of the oven. When he went to get the pizza once the timer went off, and found the melted cheese, he flipped out on me and we got into a huge fight. From then on, i put the pizza on a cookie sheet/pizza stone as he directed.\nLast week, we tried a new kind of pizza whose directions on the box say to place directly on the rack.  I used the pizza stone but the result was soggy pizza.  He complained all through eating it that it was soggy and did not like it because it was soggy and next time we should put it on the rack. I apologized.\nThis weekend, I bought same pizza and when I put it in the oven I remembered that it was soggy last time so I put it on the rack.  When BF went to get the pizza after the timer was up, you guessed it, he found cheese had melted and fallen onto the bottom of the oven - it was burnt and black.

We go back and forth while I am scrubbing away the burnt cheese.  Once clean, he says he thought it was permanent and didn\u2019t think the cheese would ever come off.. his anger is justified because it\u2019s his property. I told him he\u2019s being a jerk over melted cheese and that I had scrubbed it clean. His anger is justified, sure, he can be angry.  But I did not like the way he was treating me. I told him this. His reply was that \u201cif you think that was yelling.. you have no idea.  I can show you what yelling is\u201d.  Which to me is concerning.  If he reacts that way over melted cheese, I am concerned how he will react to what I consider a \u201creal problem\u201d (which I realize downplays something that is a real problem to him, but I still don\u2019t think melted cheese deserved the attention it got.

I made excuses why I could not for a couple of weeks, but then she asked me if I disliked her, I thought I would just tell her the truth that I do not do friendships with women.\n\nI do not recall what I said verbatim however the gist of it is that, if I spend prolonged time with a woman I start feeling for a lack of a better word 'territorial'. If they start talking with other guys or get attention from them I my intestines start roiling and I feel an extreme sense of agitation (I never act on it and I put on a happy face and persevere) however I hate said feeling and prefer to avoid it and hence I do not do friendships with women. \n\nShe then said I should see a psychologist (I will not, even though I am flawed, my flaws make up a part of who I am and I do not wish to change), and since then for the past couple of weeks our talking has just been work related.

It's a small family wedding so it was just close family invited on the ship, and then the wedding was going to be on one of the beaches where we stopped.  The other guests in attendance included the bride's parents and siblings, their kids, and the bride's and groom's kids.  My kids were also invited.\n\nThe bride's brother (42M) was pretty attractive.  I'm recently divorced so he and I started chatting and flirting.  He doesn't have kids, and was sharing a room on the ship with his father, while I shared a room with my two kids.  We wound up getting drunk and making out the first night on the cruise.  My kids didn't see, but their cousins did.  Their cousins must have been teasing my kids about it, because the next day at the buffet my daughter told me that I \"dishonored the family\" and my son barely wanted to speak to me.\n\nThen, at the formal dinner later that night, my kids insisted on sitting with me when they saw me sitting with 42M.  I was trying to send them signals to get lost but either they purposefully ignored it or were just oblivious.\n\nI later discovered that my son, probably in a way to \"act out\" had been assuming a Borat-type foreign persona during the entire cruise experience.  My daughter had been playing along.  Multiple people came up to me telling me how \"interesting\" my \"adopted Romanian son\" was.  Many people asked if there was anything wrong with him.  Then at the end of the cruise he broke down in tears saying that he was afraid if he started acting has himself again instead of this foreign persona, that the whole cruise would \"hate him.\"  It was just a total disaster.  I also found out that my son, daughter and their cousins were riding the elevators on the cruise and smooshing their faces against the glass.  Multiple people on the cruise have complained about our kids being unruly.  I feel like they are doing this to get back at me.\n\nOf course, now that we are back home they are still mad at me for making out with 42M.  We have continued to see each other but my kids don't approve and are embarrassed that I made out with him in public on the cruise.

He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills.

That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend.

Given this statament, \"AITA for quitting my cricket team after not being named captain, leading to the team losing lots of matches? | Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.\n\nSo, I'm a senior in high school and played cricket after school for a long time, among some other things such as debate, business/investing clubs, model UN, and things like that. To many guys my age, cricket is a bonafide obsession- they spend all their waking hours that they can either playing, practicing, talking about it, or watching matches on TV. \n\nI am, if I say so myself, the best player on my school team. I am, at least according to lots of people, a 'cricket underachiever'- that is, people say I have actual skill and could go places if I were to take it seriously and play on a competitive team. The thing is, I don't take cricket as seriously as most guys my age- it's fun, to be sure, and being a good player improves your popularity and attraction from girls, but I'm not extremely attached to it and have zero intention of trying to go pro. That's why I don't join any competitive teams or coaching programs- I intend to study economics/business and probably go into business in the future, and plus I enjoy spending my free time hanging out. If I were to start playing competitively, that'd take up all my time for no reason.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to be captain of my team, and everyone expected me to be. I know for a fact that most of the team voted for me (votes are public). However, I was passed over and the captaincy was given to someone else because according to the coaches 'he has more ability to build camaraderie' (the coaches are the ones who ultimately decide, regardless of votes). I felt like I had been stiffed, and as I mentioned, I don't really care all that much for cricket to begin with- it's fun, but not so fun I had to stand being stiffed. So I quit in protest, and a few of my friends did the same.\n\nSince then, the team has been suffering a lot and losing matches, and the coach is asking me to come back. I told him I wouldn't since he stiffed me over the captaincy, and he called me an asshole.\n\nAm I?

Given this statament, \"WIBTA if I send my mother a letter of grievances and don\u2019t invite her to my college graduation? | I was never a \u201cgood\u201d kid. I always got into trouble in school and this obviously put a strain on my parents. However, by the time I was about 13 I cleaned up my act. I started to actually excel in school and eventually got pretty involved with JROTC. When I was 15 I decided to take Calculus and Physics at the nearby community college the following fall, because my high school didn\u2019t offer them. At around the same time, my mother, who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Oregon, began to talk about moving away from rural Arkansas where I grew up. \n\nThis is where things started to get pretty complicated. Late spring of that year, my mother called me into her room and asked me if she \u201ccould leave.\u201d At first I wasn\u2019t sure what she was asking, but she explained her plan was to go back to Oregon to find work. Then, once she was stable, we could all join her. In the meantime, my stepfather would stay with me. However, my parents quickly found out they could not afford rent on two places at once and convinced my older sister to rent the house and take care of me. My stepfather went to go live with my step-grandparents(sgp) down the road to take care of my sick sgp.\n\nThings went fine until winter when my sister decided to move out to her boyfriend\u2019s. I thought that one of my parents would come back and stay in the house with me, but instead I went to my sgp and, along with my stepfather, they asked me straight up, at 16, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I had a job, but it could not cover nearly everything. I ended up staying with friends for long periods of time, eventually working up the nerve to ask \u201cCould I live with you?\u201d Unfortunately, a lot of people are taken aback by questions like that and I always felt awkward asking. However, eventually, I was allowed to stay on a sheep farm for $300 a month. I couldn\u2019t afford it because my job refused to give me more hours, but it was the only option I had. I begged my parents to cover the difference and after a bit of back and forth, they agreed.\n\nThankfully, from there, my life began to change. In my Junior year of high school, I received a full scholarship to boarding school. At boarding school, I found a love for mathematics and have gone on to study math at one of the top private universities in America. Next year I will graduate, and I don\u2019t want to invite my mother to graduation. I am partly still upset that even though all this shit has happened, we have never talked about it. And partly upset because nothing has changed. Recently she has been contacting me asking about graduation, but I am on the fence. I don\u2019t think she has made a good faith effort to get to know me or be present when it mattered and only at the end of college does it seem she might care.

Mine is particularly sensitive. Day before yesterday my five year old got ahold of my phone and started playing on the lock screen. In addition to locking me out of my phone for an inconvenient period of time, my five year old also managed to call 911. I could hear 5 year old talking to someone so I came from the kitchen and took the phone, asked who was there, the caller identified as a 911 dispatcher for our county.\n\nI apologized and explained that my kid had managed to dial them, we were fine, there was no emergency, it was a misdial and I would have a talk with my child about not playing with cellphones and not dialing 911. They asked for my address so they could send a squad out to check on me for verification.\n\nI know they were just doing their jobs but I was about to leave for the afternoon, there wouldn't be anyone there, and we didn't need police assistance. I know misdials to 911 are annoying and often life-threatening in the event that all operators are taking calls but in the past when I've accidentally misdialed (back in the landline/primitive mobile phone days) they've just taken my name and hung up, no police were sent to my location. But this dispatcher kept pushing the issue. She really wanted to send a couple of cops to my residence.\n\nOnce again I explained to her that we were not having an emergency, there was no danger or medical emergency at my residence, we were perfectly fine, my child simply misused my unsupervised phone, and I would not accept having police sent to my residence. Then I hung up. They didn't call back, nor did anyone for the next few hours.

When I mentioned this to my spouse they said I should have given our address to the dispatcher and let the cops come. I see that as a waste of the police department's valuable time.\n\nWas I an asshole for not giving my address to the cops?

TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friend and I moved into an apartment together around Jan 18. Around Jul 18 my roommate was told he had a kid from a one night stand he had when he was drunk. Like she told him after the child was born. At the time she told him \"Hey I don't expect any money or anything from you, I make good money, I just wanted to let you know.\" She also has another kid from a similar situation with a different dude. My roommate doesn't make very much money and I charge him only about 60% of what would actually be his share of the rent (I've known him since high school so it was no big deal for me to help him out). He pays around $350 a month and the rent would normally be around $600 for a room. No big deal since any money he pays helps me out anyway. Since finding out about his kid he has an semi-active role in the kids raising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to us moving out of the original apartment and into a nicer house late Feb 19. Days after moving in suddenly my roommate tells me \"Hey man I'm going to have to move out soon probably, It's getting hard to make rent and make payments for my kid.\" This confused me because I remember the Mom saying that she wouldn't need money from him. When I asked him why he was making payments he said \"Yeah I still have to help out.\" I understand wanting to help out, but I'm positive the mother makes more money than he and I combined. I don't know how much exactly he is paying but I am familiar with child support payments (my parents are divorced and I work at a place where i see others child support wage garnishments), and from my rough approximations he should probably only pay like $100 a month max. Him moving out really fucks me because I spent a bunch of my savings to get us moved over (repairing apartment, u haul, security deposit and other moving expenses). So I guess WIBTA if I tried to talk to my roommate and told him \"Hey dude I'm not sure how much you are paying, but you should probably be paying less.\" I would say it more tactfully obviously and this would be a longer conversation than just that one sentence.

She is self conscious about them. \n\nWhen I complimented her on them yesterday, she teared up a bit. She said that she is being bullied badly in school and that they send around a meme on Snapchat of a smiley face with a unibrow to mock her. She was so happy when school got cancelled (but they are still sending the meme!!!)\n\nIt broke my heart, I asked her if she told her mom and she said that her mom told her that they were just jealous.

I text her mom to ask, explaining what I was going to do, and we watched a movie. The movie went off and I didn\u2019t get a response. So I went ahead and did her eyebrows. I plucked the middle and shaped them up slightly, mostly maintaining their natural shape. \n\nShe was so happy. She probably stood in the mirror for half an hour looking at herself.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA for not celebrating my friend's one-year of sobriety? | (Hear me out, please.) \n\nI have a friend, let's call her Joey, who was sober (alcohol and misc. drugs) for almost a year. I met her a few months before she got sober, and it's obviously a huge part of her life so our group of friends celebrates the big milestones with her. We threw her a dinner party at 3 and 6 months in, and had one planned for her 1 year anniversary this weekend. \n\nI've been cautious about celebrating her sobriety in the past - mainly because I think it puts a lot of pressure on her, but also because she's the type of person who *doesn't* want it recognized. She wants to be the \"normal girl who doesn't need to keep track of when her last drink was,\" (her words, not mine) but she appreciates our little groups' get-togethers. \n\nThat all being said...she went on a bender two weeks ago. Got incredibly drunk, scored some pills, and got into a car wreck. She's been very apologetic/remorseful and has gone to AA/NA meetings over the past few days. Side note: we're all super supportive of her, and she has come to us in the past about struggling with addiction. A lot of us are in the mental health field, mainly counselors, so we're all very open about our problems. \n\nHowever, my friends still want to throw her an one-year sobriety party. Like the whole shebang - 1-year cupcakes, food in the shape of 1s, party banner, etc - their theme hasn't changed. Their argument is that she *almost* made it to one-year and we should celebrate that as an accomplishment. I disagree. She's made it very clear that she wants to move past it all and start over (to the point that she's currently saying she's been sober for 1 week), and I don't think throwing a party for what *was* her one-year anniversary is going to help her. Honestly, I think it might cause her to spiral. \n\nOut of the group, overwhelmingly they thought I was being unfair to bring it up, and they want to throw her a party. A handful of people agree with me, but would I be the asshole to not show up to this party? I don't want to hurt Joey, but I don't want her to be feel some ridiculous pressure to be sober again so shortly after a pretty massive bender. \n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I don't go to my friend's sober party? She was sober for almost a year, got fucked up, and has been sober for a week. Friends are still planning on celebrating a year sober. \n\nP.S. I wouldn't be against the party if it weren't for the 1-year thing. I want to be there for her as much as possible, but I don't think it's fair to Joey to get a huge reminder of her last few weeks.

After 6 weeks I told him on the phone I wasn't happy with things and was considering ending things and it seemed to flick a switch in his brain - he asked me to give him a chance to fix his mental health and we could work things out when i was back for holidays a month later. I agreed, and for the few weeks following we took space and didn't talk much and he started to turn things around.\n\nThen before the holidays, I found out my dad killed himself.

Because they stock so much food in both the fridge and the pantry for all of them, I try not to bring in too much food specifically for myself. The only two things I do buy for myself regularly are Quaker Oats oatmeal and Lactaid milk (not lactose intolerant, but I was raised on it and I like the taste of it).

Those numbers don't add up. At first, I thought that maybe I just wasn't paying attention to how many I was eating and just going through them quickly, but at a party recently, my little brother asked me if I was eating HIS packets of Quaker Oats oatmeal (He said it with a friend with him and kind of almost smirking, like he was trying rile me up and make me mad over it, but it just highlighted to me that there is a chance that he is eating them), and that made me think that he, and possibly other people in my family, were taking the foods I bring into the house for myself.\n\nI know this sounds ridiculous, but I buy that specific brand of oatmeal with my own money for myself, and there are already at least 3-4 boxes of the Trader Joe's oatmeal that the rest of my family eats in the pantry at all times, so it makes me just a little upset when someone goes into the foods I buy specifically for me, which makes me spend more of my own money to replace it.

When I saw her she would ask me if he was mad at her, and why he didn\u2019t call. \n\nSo it was a surprise to me when he began acting hysterical at her funeral. He was crying, he was screaming. He held onto her hand and sobbed when they opened the casket. He was interrupting people\u2019s speeches about her, just being totally obnoxious. He even tried to throw himself on the casket when they were lowering it into the ground. \n\nA group of people were surrounding him and trying to comfort him after the funeral.

It was an adult man, his parents, and his young cousin. So my wife does her thing and talks to these people for a bit and then they go do their thing and I didn't think much of it. The next day the young man came and asked me if he could borrow some tin foil and I said sure and then he talked my ear off  about nothing in particular.

So whatever worked for this guy, cool.\n\nWe all had lunch together and then somehow we got talked into going out for fancy coffee with these people and we are sitting around at the coffee shop bullshitting and this guy started talking about how open he is that he's in recovery and about his religion and whatever and I asked him what the most difficult part of that all was for him and he gave me some weird answer about \"sins of the flesh.\" - Which is a term that he used a few times and he basically said he's celibate and not interested in dating he just wants to find a person to marry. This was one of the first red flags for me. \n\nThen he started telling me about his church. I'm not irreligious myself and I'm not against anyone else's.

The second group (B) of friends are people that I met through my new job and at my church. I met them a couple of years after I moved so I'm a little less close with them. My little brother lives in the midwest but we are pretty close so he agreed to come for the weekend and hang out in vegas.\n\nWe agreed that we would split the cost of the airbnb and also the rental car for the people that needed a ride.\n\nThe first day goes well and everyone got along well. For the second and last day, we had a previously agreed on classic \"Vegas night out\" with a steakhouse dinner, gambling and a club. It was gonna be awesome.\n\nDinner time finally arrives and we get to the steakhouse. The service starts off a little slow and tbh, I was getting annoyed by the service. There were some gaps between courses but I got it since it was prime dinner time.\n\nWe eventually got our food and the meal was very good. We also got a free bday dessert which I shared with the group.\n\nWhen dinner was winding down, the server handed me the check. I gave the check to my friend, Anna, from group B so she could charge the bill on her credit card and Venmo everyone's share before leaving. Sidenote: we usually do this versus throwing in our own credit cards so one person gets the credit card points. Also, everyone always pays their share through so we don't have a problem with people not paying.\n\nAnna does the math and it's $83 a person. I asked Anna if she included or excluded me in the charge and she says she included me.\n\nI then told Anna that usually when we do bday dinners with friend group A, we pay for the bday person. Anna seemed to be caught off-guard and awkward. She said she wouldn't charge me. Also, no one from friend group A decided to vouch or speak up.\n\nAfter she said that, I insisted that she include me and that I just wanted to let her know since this is the first bday dinner we're celebrating together. In the end, she didn't include me in the charge and everyone ended up paying around $93, a $10 difference.\n\nAfter dinner, I noticed that Anna and the rest of my church / work friends were being a bit aloof. I started feeling weird about it so I bought them drinks at the club ($100 dollars total for 5 drinks) and apologized for bringing up the paying for the birthday girl thing at dinner.\n\nI'm starting a new job with Anna (she hired me as her replacement since she got promoted) and she will be training me for the next few weeks.

Given this statament, \"AITA for thinking my Wife's picky eating is selfish? | So let me preface that my wife does NOT have sensory issues with eating, she does not have ARFID because I realize that is a REAL issue. \n\nLet me preface this that we've been married for 8 years, have 1 kid (4 years old) and this has pretty much been a battle for the entire marriage. \n\nBasically the issue is two-fold, my wife does not want to try any foods besides what she likes (Which is mostly unhealthy foods) where-as I like to try different things and prefer to eat healthier meals. For anyone that has a picky spouse....this doesn't really work very well to just \"hold your ground\", especially with a kid because you cannot make two separate meals each time you cook. Also it doesn't really actually benefit me to do so since I usually am the one cooking (I get home earlier so it makes sense, although sometimes I do get salty about it).\n\nThe problem is basically that she refuses to try new things, any indication of trying something healthy and it's \"I don't want to eat that\". Most people would say \"Well let her make her own things\"....that doesn't work out well when you have a kid to see. Also I receive the guilt trip \"Well what am I supposed to eat then?\" etc..., it doesn't help that she's pregnant currently (3 months, but this is NOT a pregnancy thing for what it's worth) so im stuck sort of doing everything anyways. The second part to that is it's making our kid a poor eater and picky (Which was my greatest fear). \n\nSo now the kid really only likes a few things (Sound familiar?) and that makes it an even bigger pain in the ass. She also complains about her weight (before the pregnancy) but the problem is she eats fast food EVERY single day for lunch. I feel like it's impossible for me to eat healthy now (Outside of Lunch and breakfast). The fast food thing leads into my next problem which is $$$$$$.\n\nSo the secondary problem is her eating fast food for lunch everyday is EXTREMELY expensive, she also wants to go out to a lot of restaurants as well. We aren't poor by any means but I try to keep a strict budget that she is constantly breaking (and not by a few bucks, were talking 3-4 hundred a month OVER).

We live in California, and she\u2019s gotten a few minor parts in some plays, so it\u2019s not like her goals are unrealistic. \n\nHowever, she\u2019s just working as a waitress for now (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that), and wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to move to New York and support herself on her own.  She asked if we could give her some of the money that we saved by not paying for college to help her get started.  My wife and I both don\u2019t want to do that and encouraged her to go to college, take some theater classes and get a degree so if it doesn\u2019t work out she has something to fall back on.  My daughter thinks it\u2019s unfair that we spent so much on our other children\u2019s futures, but won\u2019t help her out.  We would of course support her in her dreams to be on broadway, but we wouldn\u2019t be doing it financially.

We knew everything would add up in terms of money wise, but it was for our best friend, a once in a lifetime occasion, money isn't an issue.

Obviously I know I can't compare wedding costs to a few \"gifts\" but whats a bridesmaid? a dress? hair? makeup?

I parked the car on the street in front of my parents\u2019 house around 8 p.m. and went inside. At some point during the night, somebody hit the car and drove away, because when I went outside for a run the next morning, I saw that part of the rear bumper was damaged and there were white scrape marks along the left side.

It was a 13-hour flight, and my mum had booked seats for us in the premium economy section of the plane. If you don\u2019t know what that is, essentially premium economy is one step up from economy but one step down from business, people in that section are usually afforded the same perks as business class (e.g good food and priority boarding) but just have seats similar to those in economy. \n\nSo onto the actual incident. It was hour 7 of the 13-hour flight and it was pretty much 3AM in Paris time. The way the bathrooms are laid out in the plane is there\u2019s one in the first class cabin, then one in the business cabin, premium economy is directly behind business, and then it\u2019s the larger section of the plane (economy class) with two bathrooms at the absolute back of the plane. So essentially if I were to go to the bathroom in the economy section I would have to traverse through the massive economy section in darkness. \n\nI decided I didn\u2019t really want to walk through all of the economy section to go to the bathroom, so I just went to the one in business section (which was like two meters away from my seat). I went, and when I got out, there was a lady standing there, looking super huffy about having to wait for the bathroom. There are curtains separating the business section from the premium economy section, which are directly next to the bathrooms, so I was basically halfway out of the bathroom and pushing the curtains away when she kind of pushed me away from the bathroom and said: \u201cBusiness class people only!\u201d \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t really hear her, so I turned back and I was like \u201csorry, what?\u201d.

The lady was right, that toilet was meant for business class, and it wouldn\u2019t have killed me to just be like \u201cyeah, you\u2019re right\u201d and gone back to my seat. \n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Even though I advised her (and her parents) to level up. As expected, this season she's won every competition so far and I can't think of anything to teach her anymore. In addition, I think it's not fair to the other super hard-working girls in our group. \n\nThat's why I sat down with her and her mother and told her that we wanted her to level up and can't stay another season. She could however decide for herself if she wanted to go 1 or 2 levels up. I told her it's because she's too talented to stay in our group and we can't teach her anything new anymore and it's not fair to our other gymnasts if she stays another season. \n\nShe was super flattered and happy because she wanted to learn more challenging stuff and saw it as a chance to get better, but her mother was mad at me for leaving them no choice and feels like I force them into things. \n\nAITA here?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

He would put all of his spare money into his trading account to play with and it is now approaching 3m USD.\n\nI recently asked him when we were going to get married and he brought up the topic of a prenup. He thinks that since I have little to no savings and he is worth a lot now, that he needs to protect himself \u201cjust in case.\u201d Putting aside how insulting this was that he doesn\u2019t think our marriage would last, I also think it\u2019s completely unreasonable. \n\nPrenups are supposed to protect wealth that pre-exists a relationship. All of this money was made during our relationship - including years of us living together. While it\u2019s true he pays for his share of the bills etc I don\u2019t think that matters. It wouldn\u2019t matter if we were married during this time so why should it matter if we weren\u2019t? In my opinion money made by either of us during the course of our relationship should be shared.\n\nHe insists on a prenup despite how insulting it is to ask someone he presumably loves.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Because I was in a \u201ccrisis\u201d my parents sent me to a private therapist who is 140/hr., which my parents are paying for. \n\nThroughout the 9 months I never felt a connection nor did I feel like her \u201cprocess\u201d worked for me. I felt worse after a lot of my therapy sessions, and was having anxiety just thinking of going. But I stuck it out because I know therapy can be uncomfortable and thought maybe I was the problem.\n\nAbout three weeks ago my therapist went on vacation and then I couldn\u2019t go the week after meaning I went two weeks without therapy. It was amazing. \n\nAfter this I talked to my parents about taking a break to make sure I wasn\u2019t making a rash decision. They understood my positions and supported my decision. I then called my sister who is a therapist and asked what the protocol was to end the relationship. She told me a phone call is perfectly fine.\n\nOn Monday I called my therapist, I left a short voicemail saying I was thinking of taking a break and for her to call me back to discuss. She then texted me asking if I would come in for an assessment because she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to walk away from something without making a conscious choice. I texted her back saying this was a conscious choice and that I didn\u2019t want my parents paying $140 for an assessment session. I told her I would be more than willing to have a phone session with her.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later she calls me and she basically bullies me into seeing her one more time because this her \u201cprocess\u201d and how she gets closure with her clients. She said something to the effect of \u201cit really says something about how you view your relationships if you can end this over the phone\u201d. After that comment I told her she was making me feel bad and I explained that I asked my sister what the protocol was to end a client-therapist relationship. The conversation went on for over 10 min. I was pretty clear on a final session being a waste of my time and MONEY. But she wouldn\u2019t let it go. In the end, to get her to stop, I told her I would come in next Tuesday, but I\u2019m going to cancel with a nice text explaining once again why one last session is a waste of time and money.\n\nI called my sister and Mom to get their opinions and they said it was really weird.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA If I tell someone she's better off not speaking |  I\u2019m currently in college and in one of my classes, there\u2019s a girl who may be better off not talking. She\u2019s about 21 and constantly raises her hand to share information or stories she has that are vaguely related to the topic but has no meaningful impact on the class. Almost every time she speaks in class, she stutters or trips over words, not a speech issue just because she speaks to fast, I think. Only once has she raised her hand to answer the teacher's question and that was a welcomed experience honestly. Most of the time when she raises her hand to speak in class it\u2019s unnecessary and it\u2019s gotten tiring. It happens at least once every class period. The teacher has started to give her a *look* and she\u2019s started to cut her off mid-sentence to resume class. When she gets cut off other students snicker. I\u2019m unsure if she notices it or not, but it hasn\u2019t stopped her from raising her hand.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* 1st day, we had to share basic information and a fact about us. Most people say \u201cI play basketball\u201d \u201cMy favorite color is blue\u201d etc. She goes on to say \u201cI\u2019m a fiery Irish redhead with freckles and passion and\u2026\u201d  It goes on and on.\n* Topic was prenatal development and the lecture mentioned how drugs and alcohol affect the fetus the most in the first 12 weeks. The girl raises her hand to something along the lines of \u201coh I just want to say that if you ask a nurse that deals with pregnancies, she\u2019ll tell you that drugs and alcohol will actually affect your baby throughout the pregnancy.\u201d As if that\u2019s not pretty much baseline knowledge. A guy in the back clapped for her saying this trying to be funny, I won\u2019t lie I gave a tiny laugh.\n\nThis girl actively tries speaking to me. I try to be friendly with her and let her speak. We were talking about a movie project we have, and she says she had to force her parents to watch the movie with her because her sister didn\u2019t want to watch it or something and she hates watching movies alone. I said, \u201cwhat you don\u2019t have friends?\u201d in a joking way. She got shy and had a sad tone in her voice when she said \u201coh\u2026 uhh\u2026 not really\u2026\u201d  I felt like a complete asshole.\n\nI feel bad for her, she\u2019s getting laughed at and I feel bad for the class having to put up with it. She is very annoying. I\u2019ll feel like a complete ass for trying to explain this to her, but I think it is what is morally right.

Two of her brothers live together in the house. My wife\u2019s mother and step dad come over as well to play. So the group is primarily made up of her family. I do like playing D&D but a huge plus to all of this is that she gets to spend time with them often. \n\nThe problem is the house. It has become increasingly filthy over the past few months. Partly due to the baby husky that they bought to add to their pack of 4 dogs. That dog (with the help of the others) has destroyed that house. They do not bathe the dogs at all and they are free to come into and out of the house as they please by way of doggie door. Which adds to the literal layer of dust on all hard surfaces in the house. \n\nWhenever the dogs would make a mess (pee or poop) in the house, they would just apply the big daddy fix. They would just pull out a puppy pad and place it over the piss/poop AND THEN LEAVE IT THERE! \n\nI swear to you that for two consecutive weekends we went over there and I saw the same disgusting puppy pads covering up the same mess from the weekend prior. \n\nThe house is gross for that reason but also because they don\u2019t clean. They don\u2019t sweep or mop the floors. They don\u2019t disinfect anything,, They don\u2019t wipe down the counters, they don\u2019t scrub the toilets or clean the sinks. The list goes on. You name the cleaning activity and they don\u2019t do it.\n\nBesides the fact that I think they are living in a literal health hazard, I am allergic to dogs. So I\u2019ve been toughing it out but can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m not right for days after going there.\n\nI\u2019ve brought it up to my wife and it turned into a huge fight.

I literally can\u2019t understand why I would be the asshole in this situation for wanting to tell them (at the very least) why I can\u2019t attend anymore if they insist on hosting there without doing basic cleaning. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how telling family something like this is rude. \n\nPlease give me your opinions on the matter.

Given this statament, \"AITA for leaving my door unlocked against my roommates' wishes? | For context, me and my roommates live in a small three bedroom house in Tucson,AZ. My bedroom is the master bedroom and I pay what they both pay in rent combined for it. My room was built as an add on to the house, so there's a door to our backyard in it. About a year ago, shortly after I moved in to the room, I was thinking about how convenient it would be to be able to come in through that door. A lot of times, my hands are super full coming into the house, it's the easier door to open, and the bed is right there when you walk in so I can drop everything if it's heavy. I am also one of those people who always forgets something inside, so locking the door is always a pain because a lot of times I'm going to have to unlock it immediately anyway.\n\nThen I realized, why not leave it unlocked? How much does a locked door actually deter a burglar? I did some quick research and while consensus is generally in favor of locking your doors, there are some people that leave their doors unlocked. I didn't see it any different really as leaving a spare key somewhere nearby. I've been burgled before, while I was sleeping and with a dog in the house, so I know that if a burglar really want's to get in, one small deadbolt isn't going to stop them. I decided to start leaving the door unlocked, and I didn't tell my roommates because in my opinion there wasn't anything to tell.\n\nNow, one year later, my roommates find out about it. They think there's no reason to leave the door unlocked and they ask me to start locking it. I explained everything above to them, but they did not agree. One of my roommates then proceeded to enter my room every day to lock it from the inside against my wishes. I'm a big proponent of not getting into fights with your roommates, so I let it slide for a while hoping that maybe he would give up, or maybe I would get used to it. But every time I had to pee, or the wind was whipping around outside, and the smart lock on our front door wouldn't open and I had to re-pair my phone to it, I grew a little bit more resentful. One of my roommates has a pet, even though that's against our lease, but I take that risk. And he's moving out in June!\n\nA couple of days ago, I locked my room's interior door from the inside so that if my roommate wanted to lock it, he would have to go outside and use his key. This started a rehashing of the whole fight, and now we're stuck. My argument is that the thing they are scared of is not any more likely whether or not I leave my door unlocked, at least not in a reasonable way. I am taking the same risk as them, yet I am not scared. The idea came up that I should pay if any of their stuff gets stolen, but then I am providing them with free insurance since there's probably not going to be a way to know whether my door being locked would have deterred the thief. Their argument is that they are not getting any benefit from this, and thus should not have to take any risk no matter how minute it is.\n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for keeping more inheritance money than my sisters? | My parents both died within about a year of each. Mum died in November. The way my parents did their inheritance was that whoever died first would leave everything to the other and when they died it would be given out (most of the money was in a shared bank account so technically he 'left' my mother almost nothing for logistical purposes and to avoid her having to pay inheritance tax - the house was also put in my name a year before my father's death for the same reasons). We're Muslim and my parents were quite religious. My sisters and I less so, but we\u2019re still practising and have strong faith.\n\nI am the only son and I\u2019m the oldest child so, as per Islamic inheritance law, I get 50% whilst my sisters get 25% each. They also left the house to me, but since we all have our own houses and none of us wanted to keep the house, we put it up for sale and everything was processed last week. \n\nTechnically I should get all the money from the sale but since that\u2019s not fair and doesn\u2019t keep to the 50/25/25 rule, I said I\u2019ll more than happily give them 25% each. They were both upset by this and by me getting 50% in the first place, which they did mention beforehand but we were all still grieving over the loss of both our parents so we never really talked about it. My parents were doctors and so were fairly well-off and the house sold for over \u00a3600k, and the whole inheritance totals to well over \u00a31mn so this isn\u2019t a small amount of money.\n\nI explained that it was left in my name and they aren\u2019t entitled to any money from the sale at all and it wasn\u2019t in my parents\u2019 wishes to give them any of it either. We debated a lot about this being Islamic law and my parents wanting to follow it and how we should also follow it. A few older family members have weighed in and they all say that it shouldn\u2019t be split 33/33/33 (some say I\u2019m doing the right thing by keeping to the 50/25/25 rule whereas others say I shouldn\u2019t actually be giving them any at all). Splitting it equally would be against Islam. It surprises me that they're doing this, we're relatively traditional in that when it comes to matters like this, or family disputes, we listen to our parents, but not a small amount so I do understand. They're really unhappy about the inheritance not from the house but accept it as it was written into the will and believe asking me to give them money to make it equal would definitely be un-Islamic but still feel unfairly treated.\n\nNone of us needs the money, we\u2019re all established doctors in our late 40s, all married to other doctors and we all have 2 kids so none of us needs it more than the others. I don\u2019t want to cause friction in our relationship but I\u2019m just following what my parents would\u2019ve wanted and I\u2019m giving them more as well.

When I first started working there, I absolutely loved it. However, due to various site closures, we've basically become a 'dumping ground' for patients who can't go home, but can't stay in hospital. I was mostly fine with it, as we were a palliative/end of life (EOL) unit with patients who had complex health issues. Now, we're basically a free care home. \n\nWe have numerous patients with cognitive/behavioural issues, which we're not trained for (we're adult nurse trained, with BASIC mental/learning disability knowledge) so it reaches a point where you can't be a patients verbal and physical punch bag anymore.

She's always been blunt with her staff, which at first I respected, because at least you knew where you stood. Now, she will pick at anything for an excuse to tell at you. Her complaints over the last few months have gotten even more cutting and demoralising; a few prime examples are complaining we don't 'use our initiative' however as soon as we do, she tells us it's wrong. She's accused us of 'killing patients' by not offering our EOL patients food (they're basically comatose, have no swallow, and would likely die from choking rather than their actual condition) and she tried to report me for a drug error that wasn't actually wrong. It wasn't until the medical team AND THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE GUIDELINES ON THE Drug told her that I was right, she backed down.\n\nI've only stayed at my job as long as I have due to the fact my sickness level has been so high.

Given this statament, \"AITA for being pissed at my dad although I damaged his most valued possession, but it wasn't my fault? | Tl;dr at the end\n\nAlright, here's the issue. \n\nMy dad bought himself a triumph motorcycle a couple years ago and it's his most valued possession. We're not that rich, so it's one of the most expensive things he's splurged on and he's taken good care of it every single day. \n\n\nI've recently turned 18 and learnt how to ride a motorcycle on a smaller bike, and slowly transitioned to using this huge, heavy monstrosity for errands nearby. I'm not allowed to take it very far yet, because it weighs about 4 times as much as I do and controlling it in high traffic takes experience.\n\nNow here's the issue. About 2 weeks ago, while parking the bike, I fell down and screwed up the clutch and gear of the bike. Luckily, the repair wasn't expensive at all and since it was my first fall, he let it slide and asked me to be more careful next time. \n\nNow we move to today. He asked me to take the bike and go buy a couple things for him from 2 different stores. One store is the farthest he's ever let me take the bike, and one's pretty close to our house. I went and got the farther one done without a hitch. As for the second store, I parked the bike on a slight incline and went in. When I came out, I wore my helmet, put on my bag, and started the bike. Unfortunately, while I was inside, some dumbass played with the bike and pulled the choke and messed with the gears. The bike suddenly pulled and I ended up falling on my right. \n\nNow, I pushed the choke back in, and everything was fine and dandy. The thing is, my leg is fucked thanks to a hot exhaust and a heavy bike falling on my leg, and he didn't even bother looking at it. The second I went home, and told him, he ran to his bike and screamed his head off at me for getting scratches on it. I agree, there were a bunch of scratches, but it isn't my fault. It really pissed me off that he didn't Even bother looking at my burns and bleeds. We got into an argument, and he banned me from using any of the motorcycles at home. He also said he isn't going to buy me the car I was promised, and that he'd use my bank account to pay for the paint job and repairs for the bike. \n\n\nI don't think that's fair. I've been a good kid my whole life. I turned 18 a couple months ago. Everyone falls from their bikes while learning, and this wasn't even my fault, but now it looks like my dad and I have become mortal enemies. My mum is on my dad's side, saying I shouldn't have damaged his one and only prized possession, and that I shouldn't touch any geared vehicle anytime soon. It got me thinking I'm at fault, and I feel like shit now.\n\n\nTl;dr- My dad bought an expensive motorcycle which he recently let me start riding since I turned 18.

The Squatty Potty takes a week to arrive. She noticed I bought it a day later and asked me about it.

She said she doesn\u2019t know I squat poop and I shouldn\u2019t have on the toilet before because it\u2019s dangerous and I could die if the toilet gives in, shatters, and the porcelain cuts my arteries. I\u2019m 200 lbs and never had a problem. My mom also said she doesn\u2019t believe squat pooping has any benefits. I told her it\u2019s more healthy and efficient, but she disagrees.

I showed her online sources that point to squat pooping being healthier, however she said she doesn\u2019t want to read it and that it\u2019s bogus. \n\n\nShe told me to cancel the Squatty Potty order because it\u2019s big and she doesn\u2019t want it in the bathroom. I said I would put it in my room and bring it to the bathroom whenever I need to. She said it\u2019s unhygienic to do that and told me to cancel my order.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA if i told my boyfriend i didn't want his \"family heirloom\" engagement ring? | sup long time lurker, first-time poster\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. It's been awesome and we have talked about taking the next steps into engagement and marriage. I'm pumped, he's great. The engagement is at least several months off.   \n This last weekend we were visiting his mom, she's quite the character, has been married 5 times, they have a tumultuous relationship. She and I were talking and she asked if I'd seen the ring yet, immediately my heart \\~fluttered\\~ a little bit, because omg he already got the ring!! How exciting!! I was like no and I wouldn't want to!! I wouldn't want to spoil the moment of seeing it for the first time when he gives it to me.  She goes on to say that she's surprised I haven't come across it already in his house somewhere and that he's had it in his possession for around 3 years- when he picked it up from her safety deposit box when he was getting ready to propose to his previous girlfriend.  My heart sank a bit, he and his previous girlfriend were together on and off for 6 years and it's a bit of a tender spot for me, because they have so much history, ya know? I knew that he had almost proposed to his ex, but it had fallen apart. I did not know he was planning on using the same ring he had originally intended for her.  His mother goes on to say that it's her ring from her first marriage and that she loved that ring the most and that I will love it, and that this ring is so special to her, referring to it as a family heirloom. Bf was born during her second marriage so this ring isn't remotely tied to him?? I do not know if I am being too sensitive but I do not really want this ring because to me, he once intended this for someone else, I feel I would be reminded of his ex whenever I looked at this ring. Plus it is not like it a true family heirloom passed down from a great grandmother or something, it is just his mom's (who he is very hot and cold with) first marriage ring. He has very sufficient funds to afford a new ring, and I have told him before that I wouldn't care if it was a ring from pandora. It isn't about how expensive the ring is or how big it is, but something about this random ring from his mom that he was going to use for his ex makes it all feel... so much less special and intimate?  After leaving his mom's I asked one of our mutual friends to ask him discreetly if he was planning on using his mom's ring and he told her he was.  WIBTA if I told him in the nicest way possible that I don't want that ring? I just want something special and meaningful. I don't know if I'm making a bigger deal about this than I should be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend is planning on proposing to me with a ring from his mom that he originally planned to use to propose to his ex\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for confronting my SO's friend? | Context for later: my SO's friend got into a car accident 2 weeks ago, in which she collided head-on with a tree because she was on her phone. This is important for later. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SO goes to college, and carpools with a friend. Their school is quite far (45 min. on a good day) so they carpool. I sometimes go and pick up my SO if need be, or if we have plans later. The days I go pick her up ends up being me out of the house from around 2 in the afternoon to 7 or 8,\n\nHere's the issue. My SO's friend is usually good when it comes to driving her back home, but the times she doesn't are always due to rather petty things and very short notice. Sometimes she'll leave early and tell my SO at the last second, forcing me to ditch the time I had for schoolwork and fucking up my schedule as well as my SO's.\n\nThen there's today. I've been working on an important project for one of my classes, and my SO texts me that her friend can't take her home because she's doing her mother's hair at noon, when both their classes end around 4. This pissed me off because they had agreed to carpooling way before that, as well as to take my SO to a nail appointment after school, and they wouldn't reasonably be home until about 9. \n\nI don't get mad at things like this. I try to use reason and see everything from both sides. I told her friend that while I know it's hard to say \"no\" to a parent, it seems to be inconsiderate to change plans with my SO at the last second, making me abandon my schoolwork while jeopardizing my SO's plans in the afternoon. She then told me that I have no right to get mad (which I wasn't), I occasionally pick her up from school anyways, and that her mom comes first. Then I told her that I agree family does come first in many cases, but doing her mom's hair isn't as pressing as going through with taking someone home, especially when that agreement came first.\" This caused her to tell me that \"things come up\" which causes plans to change. I told her that her argument would be valid for an actual emergency, but that I thought leaving my SO without a ride and forcing me to put my schoolwork on hold for the entire day was a bit rude (especially when this is far from the first time), and that I felt her mom's hair wasn't the highest priority compared to a deal she made first. \n\nThen, she told me she wasn't gonna waste her time arguing with me, and that she wasn't gonna sit there and argue when \"I know that to me, I'm right\". I felt I hadn't said anything to warrant that, which pissed me off. I told her \"Logic and reasoning don't matter when your feelings keep you sure in yourself\" and then \"remember next time you're driving that your main priority is not hitting trees and staying on the road, maybe that'll help you keep your priorities straight.\" Then she called me a dick, and the conversation ended. She's been doing this to my SO many times, and I felt like today was when I had to speak up. Was ITA, guys? \", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.
