My brother used to cook with me and it was a neat little bonding activity we did together. About a month ago tho he called me a shit cook and how he hates everything I make. I felt very disrespected by that and while we made up I don't want him to help me cook or any of that. Thanksgiving is coming up and I have volunteered to help my mom cook the meal. I was sorta testing out some foods (just small dishes for tests). My brother tried to come and try some of it and maybe I'm pissed but I really didn't want him calling me names or any of that while I was just testing stuff out so I basically told him to get out of the kitchen and leave me alone. My mom overheard that and told me to be nicer to him, I had to let him eat my food and yet again that little fucker said that it was trash and poured the rest down the sink. I had enough with him constantly criticizing and making fun of my hobby and passion so I called him an asshole before just storming off. My mom came to talk to me about 15 minutes later after she got done yelling at my brother for being mean and forcing him to clean the dishes. She told me that I am grounded for the rest of the week (friday-sunday) just like my brother. I tried to protest but I know whatever I said wasn't gonna work.\n\nI am so done with my brother always critiquing my shit and honestly I don't even wanna cook on thanksgiving anymore cause he will just embarrass me in front of our extended family.\n\nAITA?\n\nREPOST CAUSE I DIDNT LIKE THE TITLE AND ASKED WRONG QUESTION\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for saying the best day of my life had more to do with my ex-girlfriend than my wife? | My little sister (25F) was fondly talking about her wedding that happened two weeks ago. She said that was the best day of her life. I (27M) said that my wedding day that happened last year was awesome too. She asked me if I also thought my wedding day was the best day of my life. My wife (25F) was next to me, but I thought it was best to be truthful and said that was a close second best day of my life. They both asked me at the same time what the best day of my life was then. I told them that it was May 21, 2013. \n\n\n\nI told them the story. I was always a shy virgin kid who had hopes of becoming an actor. By that time, I had been wanting to audition for over two years but never had the courage to. My roommate gave me a shot of vodka and off I went. I took the train to LA and strutted right into the building. I met this beautiful lady in the elevator and she was auditioning too. We helped calm each other down to put our best chops forward. I never felt that comfortable with a woman before. I felt that if I didn\u2019t ask her out after the audition, I would never get this perfect chance to get my first girlfriend again. It took all my courage to ask her out. I was pretty sure I had her at hello, but it still wasn\u2019t easy to do something I have never done before. We had a nice Korean barbecue dinner together and dated for a few months. We both didn\u2019t pass the audition and pursued the safe path. We had to break up because she had to move overseas with her family, but I was a different man after doing something I have always wanted to do in auditioning and also for meeting her. It was a day of many firsts of my life. I became confident in both my career and personal life because of that. \n\n\nMy wife said she was kind of sad that the best day of my life had to do with my ex-girlfriend and not her. I said that if I hadn\u2019t met my first girlfriend, I probably wouldn\u2019t have met my wife, and everything happens for a reason. I might have been a virgin all my life if I hadn\u2019t shot my shot and she said yes. I said she opened the door for me to many possibilities, and my wife was the best woman I have ever known, and that we have been together for almost five years and hopefully forever. My wife said that since the best day of my life isn\u2019t the day we met or our wedding day, hopefully the best day of my life would be when our first child will be born in March. I told her that this is getting silly and that will probably be one of the top five days of my life. My wife and sister talked about other things afterwards. My wife seemed kind of down from then on.

My son's been fine since then.\n\nThe other day, however, I mentioned this story to a friend of mine and she was disgusted by my and my husband's form of punishment. She said that it amounted to extreme mistreatment of a child. I think she's being overdramatic, and even my son agrees that it wasn't that bad.

It's been a problem with a little over half of my class, but ESPECIALLY with one girl \\[5f\\] (I'll call her Sally).\n\nI've had multiple, specific talks with her parents before about not sending her in costume, but they seem to forget after a few days.\n\nToday, Sally came fully in costume from tiara down to heels. I gently reminded her mom when she dropped her off that, although she looked cute, costumes were not allowed in class unless it was a spirit day and I would have to have her change into her extra clothes to continue the day. She just rolled her eyes and left.\n\nI talked to my school director and she said just to remind parents of my classroom policy, so I sent out an email to all my parents that said:\n\n\"Good afternoon, parents! Just a reminder: costumes are not allowed in class! Aside from being a distraction to the learning process, they pose a potential safety risk to your children. Please remember that your children's day to day activities consist of moving around and (occasionally) getting messy, so keep that in mind when dressing your child! Any concerns may be addressed to myself or \\[school director\\]. Thank you!\"\n\nThis afternoon, Sally's mom came to pick her up and screamed at me for singling her child out in my email and trying to police what her daughter wore. She said I was ruining her self confidence and that she seriously questioned my understanding of children by forbidding her daughter's \"self-expression\". She also was very upset that I didn't talk to her personally about Sally's outfit, but, like I said, I tried to this morning and I also have had this conversation with her at least 4 times since December (plus she's not the only parent I've had to tell).\n\nI understand that sometimes kids fight to wear a certain thing in the morning and parents just give in because it's not worth it the argument, but I feel like I have to draw the line somewhere.\n\nSo, Reddit: AITA for sending a whole class message after one student's outfit violated my class rules?\n\ntldr; One of my Pre-K students violated my \"no costumes\" classroom rule and I sent a whole-class email out about it to remind all parents about the rule (almost all of my students have broken this rule since December)\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Coco I found this summer on a bike ride, as tiny as kittens come, brought her home and took care of her. Was going to rehome her but my girlfriend grew attached and we kept her. Both are super cuddly and affectionate, and are adored by everyone who comes over. \n\nFast forward to a recently. My girlfriend of almost two years has had aggressive diabetes since she was born, and was recently told she has 10% kidney function and will have to go in dialysis, and she's only 25. Her failing kidneys meant aaaallooottttt of dietary restrictions, including Claritin. She's allergic to cats and has had to take a pill or two just to come hang out when we started dating, otherwise she looks like a bee stung her and she's barely comfortable in her own skin. So with the news, I decided I'd rehome my cats, letting them go live with my recently widowed step mom and my two little sisters (this way they'll be loved, my family will have a li'l happiness in a shitty time, and I can see them whenever I want). The girlfriend was racked with guilt and has been depressed already with all the changes we're making over her health.\nI told my friends over group chat about the cats leaving and why and they were more upset over me giving away the cats than over my girlfriends predicament, especially one girl in particular who kept making it sound as though I was personally killing the cats \"for some chick\" . Two days ago was our roommates birthday and that same girl got a card that said \"happy birthday teddy bear, sorry straightupforrealtho is killing your favourite cat (boo) just for his girlfriend\". My girlfriend was heart broken and embarrassed , especially since she spent the day cleaning the house and baking a cake and decorating just for everyone to have fun.\n\n I'm really trying to do the best I can for both my cats and my girlfriend, but am I the asshole here?

I put a muzzle on my dog, because he gets aggressive around strangers.\n\nI was dropped off and I immediately noticed a drunk father-son duo outside my friend's house, working on her front porch. They also brought their Dachshund, who was quite the \"friendly\" dog. My German Shepherd immediately started to circle him once he was unleashed, but I redirected him to the backyard. Twenty minutes passed and my friend's dogs wanted exercise, so her and I took our dogs to the front of the house. \n\nWhen it noticed my dog, the Dachshund I mentioned before started to bark at him, jump on him, etc. and that *bothered* my dog so I nudged the Dachshund away for his own good. The man looks at me, \"Why did you push him away? He was just being friendly.\" I explain to him that my dog wears a muzzle for a reason, and that he hasn't had good interactions with other dogs, especially small ones.\n\nThis guy just didn't get it, and neither did his son, who took my dog's aggression as a personal attack, \"That's not true. Your dog is fine around your friend's dogs. You pushed our dog away because it bothered you, not your pet.\" The argument got more heated,\tand as I continue saying that my German Shepherd is an aggressive dog, they begin to taunt me saying that if he was truly aggressive he'd be put down already.\n\nDuring this whole thing my friend is trying to calm us down, but these guys pissed me off. I tell them, \"Fine, if you don't think he's aggressive, I'm gonna take his muzzle off.\" They back off immediately, my friend's trying to grab me because that really was a dumb move and my family could've gotten sued, but I didn't care because my dog was leashed. I take his muzzle off, and my German Shepherd goes apeshit; barking, pulling on the leash, growling.\n\nIt felt like holding back a rhino. Their dog gets scared and runs off.

My friend gets scared of my dog, and *I* get scared of my dog because he's larger than me, so at that point I thought if I intervened he would harm me (which wouldn't be his first time).

She was shockingly rude to the client, and I had to pull her aside and tell her to leave then make an excuse that she wasn\u2019t feeling so well. It was successful though, since the client\u2019s culture had an oddity where you weren\u2019t \u201cresponsible\u201d for a spouse\u2019s outburst so long as you take measures to get them under control. It\u2019s not a great outlook, but it worked out for me, and all cultures are different. I lost a lot of trust in her for this, though she apologized and felt bad, and said that she was feeling increasingly upset and lost control, somewhat understandably. We had a long conversation about it, worked through it, and she agreed to the boundary of not being involved with any work functions save some exceptions (dinners with coworkers I feel she can agree with, etc.).\n\nI had another similar function and my boss was pretty insistent on me bringing a date. I told him about how my fianc\u00e9e and I handled the last time I brought her, and he said that I could just bring a friend or anyone, really. It was a status symbol to this particular client, and the event was already one where PDAs would be inappropriate, so I could just bring a friend or basically anyone as a +1. He said I wouldn\u2019t see the executives again, and given that I\u2019m just an engineer I\u2019d only ever be with their low level managers/engineers/computer architects and once the infrastructure was in place most likely not even them, and that all of these interactions are impersonal in the first place.\n\nI decided to take my sister and my fianc\u00e9e has been angry about it since.

Surprisingly she has been pissy about it from when I told her. She thinks that it\u2019s much worse than going alone since it communicates not that I\u2019d just be better alone, but that she in particular is inadequate. She also thinks that it\u2019s equivalent to hiding our relationship, \u201calmost says\u201d that my sister is \u201cbetter to show off by my side\u201d (which I find gross for her to say), and is a general public shot against our relationship to my coworkers who know her and see me bring someone else. I think she\u2019s being ridiculous. She\u2019s the one who made me not trust her in this situation, any coworker that knowledgeable about my life also knows who my sister is and that our boss explicitly informed us to bring a date, and my sister is clearly the most diplomatic choice since choosing her carries no undertones or implications that might arise had I brought a female friend.

She has never had any interest in my husband (her son) or my children ( her grandchildren). \n\nWhen DD was born, I asked her to keep DS while I was in the hospital giving birth. She let him stay at her house, but she hired a baby sitter to take care of him. That\u2019s the only time DS has ever stayed with her in his entire life. DD has never stayed with her, not once. When DD was only two weeks old, DH got shingles. The doctor said it was dangerous for a newborn to be exposed to shingles. I had to pack up DS and DD and leave our home and leave my sick husband by himself. I went to MILs house, explained the situation, and asked for her help. She refused to help us. After my husband got better, she laughed at me and rubbed my nose in the fact that I asked for help and didn\u2019t get it.  We told her how hurt we were by the way she treated us, but she refused to acknowledge our feelings and refused to apologize. Needless to say, I never asked for her help again. \n\nShe moved out of our area a couple of years later, which was a relief for me.

A year prior I had gotten a cell plan witch included four lines of service, another feature was the plan had roll over minutes that built up for a year. Any unused minutes were saved and used in case I went over and I would pay no extra fees. My brother, mother and I each used a line and the other one just sat around with out use.

Rather than a traditional wedding, my fianc\u00e9e (30F) and I have planned a group trip to one of the most beautiful places in the world. We've booked an excursion package that will take us and our guests to various spas/tourist locations/etc. and we plan to do the actual wedding ceremony on the last day of the trip. Following that, our guests will go home, and my then-wife and I will travel elsewhere for another week as our honeymoon. \n\nThe problem is: the excursion package we booked is limited to 14 people, including my fianc\u00e9e and I. If we wanted a bigger group, we'd have to upgrade to the next package, which would be considerably more pricey and not within our allocated wedding budget. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I have planned out the guest list as follows: my mother, her parents, her twin sister, her two younger brothers, my four older siblings, and two very close mutual friends of ours. \n\nHere's the thing. Though my older siblings and I are all very close in age, my mother got pregnant again by a different father when I was 12. My mother was doing very poorly at the time (financial struggles, problems with addiction, ongoing depressive episodes) and didn't feel capable of taking care of another child. So, my youngest brother ended up getting raised primarily by my mother's cousin, though he's been living at home with my mom since he was 14.\n\nHe's now 19, and unfortunately neither I nor my other siblings are very close with him. We see him on major holidays and occasionally when we all visit home, but due to both the age difference and the fact that he wasn't raised by our mother we just haven't been able to maintain a significant relationship. \n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9e and I were putting together the guest list, I considered including him, but with the strict limitations on guest numbers it came down to him vs. one of my best friends. Honestly, I'm far closer with my friend. \n\nAfter we invited everyone, my mom called me to tell me that my brother was incredibly upset that he hadn't been invited. She said that she couldn't believe that I would leave him out of a family event like this, especially as he's been left out of so much \"family stuff\" throughout his life. But my other siblings agree with me \u2013 none of them are very close with him either, and they know they wouldn't chose him over their best friends if the choice had to be made. \n\nI feel bad about hurting his feelings, but I still think it's my and my fianc\u00e9e's decision who we invite to our wedding. \n\nThoughts?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Bro and his GF don\u2019t have a lot of money and they were really stressing about buying him a new laptop. I\u2019m much better off financially than them, so I said that I\u2019d buy him the laptop for his birthday. So I went out and bought him a Lenovo ideaPad for about $1600 - not top-of-the-line, but certainly more than enough for what he needed.\n\nSo Friday was his birthday and we all went to their place for dinner and the kid was basically vibrating out of his seat with excitement over his new laptop. First chance he gets he rips into it and immediately his face just drops.\n\n\u201cOh, a Lenovo\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d I ask\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just - ya know - not a very good brand\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, alright\u201d\n\nHe then moves onto his other presents - without saying thank you - and I just sat there completely dumbfounded. He\u2019s usually a good kid, which is exactly why I thought he deserved it in the first place. So this completely threw me but I decided to let it go for now because I didn\u2019t want to ruin his birthday. \n\nBut he kept making these little backhanded remarks, like when he was finished opening his presents, he plugged in the laptop and started to set it up. Now, obviously, it\u2019s a brand-new laptop booting up for the first time, so it\u2019s taking a while.\n\nMy mum says \u201cHow\u2019s the laptop, \\[Name\\]\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s booting up ... extremely slowly\u201d\n\nSo after 3 or 4 of these little jibes, I snapped and just took it from him.\n\nI said -\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be an ungrateful little shit, then you get nothing.\u201d\n\nAnd I put it back in the box, apologised to Bro and GF for making a scene, and left.\n\nSo now it\u2019s 3 days later and I\u2019m wondering if maybe I could have handled the situation a little better. Bro and GF completely support my position and are mortified by his behaviour, but my parents think I\u2019m being too harsh.\n\nI\u2019m completely torn. On the one hand, he did act like a little entitled brat and I think he should be punished for his behaviour. He refuses to apologise because he thinks I\u2019m the asshole who ruined his birthday. I must say that not only am I angry that he wasn\u2019t more grateful, I\u2019m actually quite hurt that I went out of my way to buy him an expensive gift that I thought he\u2019d love and he completely snubbed it.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel bad for making a scene at dinner and calling him a \u2018little shit\u2019 (as I said, he\u2019s usually quite a good kid). I also feel bad that his parents are now going to have to scrap and save to get him the laptop that he needs for school. I was thinking of maybe giving them the laptop.

My dad used to be a partner at a law firm but retired. To spend time with him and to keep his mind sharp I have him look over contracts for me. So when I was signing everything for my apartment I had him look over the papers. Not a lot of people know this, but when people hand you contracts to sign, they are actually starting a negotiation and you can actually make amendments to the contract. For example, I'm exempt from the no-smoking rule, I can use the roof whenever I want as opposed to from(10-7) or with expressed permission and I can use the gym whenever I want. This all was going swimmingly until I decide to go to the gym after work. I'm doing my thing for about thirty minutes and then I was pleasantly surprised when a bunch of girls walked in. I just smiled and waved and went back to my business.  As I was leaving a girl side-barred me and said, \"I didn't want to interrupt you because I can tell your new but we actually have a lady's hours from 4-5\" I informed her that my rental agreement is slightly different from the standard one and that I'm exempt from that rule. I reassured her that I'll keep to myself. Apparently I did a bad job at reassuring her because I get a call from my landlord asking me to not use the gym during that time period. I told him that I won't go out of my way to go to the gym during lady hour but I won't go out of my way to avoid it either. He threaten to not renew my lease and I was like \"okay I wasn't going to renew my lease anyway\". I guess he realized that was all he could do and hasn't bothered me since. The boyfriend or husband of one of girls tried to intimidate me but I called his bluff and he hasn't bothered me since either. I have noticed lady hour being less popular which is unfortunate but ultimately not my problem, but a couple of the girls have warmed up to me and even invite me to work out with them occasionally too, so it isn't like I'm completely unwelcome but I still get the occasional death glare. I was reliving the whole idea to my family at family dinner. My dad thought the whole thing was hilarious but my sister thinks I'm TA because I'm making women feel uncomfortable.  So I thought I'd ask reddit. IMO my landlord agreed to this and the way it is being implemented makes it legally questionable in the first place.

Before the christmas break a couple of people were talking about how they\u2019d been invited to Sally\u2019s party group on Facebook - it was absolutely no skin off my nose that I hadn\u2019t been invited.\n\nA couple of days ago I got a notification that Sally had invited me to her party group. I checked that I was free on the date, and RSVPed as \u2018going\u2019. The next day at work Sally came over to chat, and said that she was sorry about not inviting me straight away, but she didn\u2019t know that I had Facebook (even though we were friends on it, and had been for months?). I said that it was fine, and I was looking forward to going. A few hours later during lunch, one of the people who had been going to the party from the beginning asked to speak in private. She said that she\u2019d noticed that I was now going to Sally\u2019s party, and said that I should know that, in a group chat that she was in with Sally and a couple of the other party-goers, Sally had mentioned that she was going to be \u2018forced\u2019 into inviting people to the party in order to cover the costs for the venue hire (I assume she meant through gifts of money, or the value of gifts?). Someone had asked who, and she specifically mentioned me by name, saying that she \u2018wouldn\u2019t do it unless she was absolutely desperate\u2019. This person showed me the chat, so I know that it actually happened.\n\nI immediately removed myself as \u2018going\u2019 from the group. When I was walking out at the end of the day, Sally asked why I wasn\u2019t going to the party anymore, and I said that I\u2019d realised it wasn\u2019t going to be an evening that I was going to enjoy. Her face broke from the fake concerned smile she\u2019d be holding, and snapped that no one liked me anyway, and her friends would be shocked that she knew such a vile person as myself.

We\u2019re not ride or die, but whenever we\u2019re both in the same region we always meet up.\n\nI ordered a nice yellow jumpsuit for the wedding from a trusted retailer. When it came, it was much paler than the picture, basically a straw yellow. I started to worry as I\u2019d read those stories about guests wanting to steal the thunder by wearing white/traditional wedding dress colours at weddings, and I messaged my friend to ask if she was wearing white.

She said that it looked fine, and she\u2019d shut anyone up if they tried to make a deal about it on the day.\n\nOn the day itself, I didn\u2019t actually get any comments about it directly, which was a relief. However, when I went to the bathroom, I encountered two of the bridesmaids gossiping about how that girl in the jumpsuit (so, me) had the nerve to wear it, especially after the bride had told her directly it wasn\u2019t suitable. To frame this as it happened, I was in a cubicle when they came in and started chatting. I came out of the cubicle, and said that no such conversation had happened, and if the bride really had an issue she should have told me months ago when we talked about it.

I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn\u2019t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I\u2019d been asked for \u2018receipts\u2019, here they were. The comment got a few further comments saying that the tea had been spilled and that this is what happens when people don\u2019t know all the facts, as well as the inevitable ones saying that I was being childish and creating a drama.\n\nI do view this as stooping down to the level of those who couldn\u2019t even tell me straight there was an issue (I mean I had another dress in my car just in case I got comments) in how I reacted, but I also think I was defending my reputation and honour among people I\u2019ve known for over two decades.

Given this statament, \"AITA for accepting it when I \"got my way\" after crying? | Some light backstory: I'm a crier. I cry at *everything.* I'm not even usually all that upset when it happens, it's just a weird physical reaction that I go through at the slightest hint of negative emotion (my own or others). My boyfriend of the last year has been *incredibly* understanding and patient with me about this, and I'm working with a therapist to get a better handle on myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the issue: we recently went out to the other side of the country to visit my family, which was his first time really spending a good amount of time with them. They all get along great, which I couldn't be happier about! One of the days we were out there, though, I went through a small series of inconveniences (a small screw-up on a work email I had to deal with, our dogsitter accidentally locked herself out of our house so I had to call our neighbor to let her in, things like that) that soured my mood a little bit-- and then I found out my dad had gotten us dinner reservations for a seafood place that I'm sort of ambivalent to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where I potentially become the asshole. No one in my family makes a ton of money, so we don't go out to dinner very often; for that trip, it was reasonable to assume we'd only being going out the one time. Not only was I ambivalent to the chosen restaurant, but there's another restaurant in town that I really love and I'd hoped we'd be able to go to that one, and I guess on top of all the other tiny disappointments throughout the day it was just the one that pushed too far and I started crying. To be clear, I wasn't even that upset! Just a little disappointed. But I couldn't stop myself from crying. I really, really tried, it just happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad asked what was wrong, and I told him honestly that I'd hoped we could have gone to the restaurant that I liked instead, and he offered to cancel the reservation for the seafood place and get a reservation for the other place the following night instead. I accepted, and was really grateful. It was a really nice thing for him to do, and I really appreciated it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend was *mortified.* He said that the way I complained was whiny and childish, and he couldn't believe that after all the work I've put into not giving my tears the weight of genuine sadness that I'm not even feeling, that I would \"manipulate\" my dad by crying to get my way. I'm still kind of in shock that he saw it that way. I told him it wasn't like that, my family's used to how I cry over nothing, and he said that's even worse because that just means they know to drop everything and \"fix what's wrong\" with me so I stop. I don't know. I'm really shaken by this, am I really being manipulative? Should I have told him not to change the reservations even though I was really happy he did? I don't think anyone was heart-set on the seafood restaurant, but I guess I didn't get a chance to ask. So please, Reddit, I need some outside perspective.

I'm a guy who had a male housemate for two years and in the second year his fiancee moved in as well after she finished undergrad in another town.

I had a friend with me, which is nicer than being alone, and she got to hang out with a bunch of people besides me that she knew at the reception. In retrospect, I've started to wonder whether this was taking advantage of the bride's parents - they were paying for each guest after all, and the spirit of the wedding tradition is that new and old couples are celebrating the formalization of another couple's commitment to each other.

I would only be able to take half of the projected lessons. \n\nWithout thinking I just yelled \"What do you want me to end up in a dead end job like you!\" I immediatly regreted saying that and my mom just stopped and went to her room. I coulnt believe that I said that and I basically spent the rest of my night just crying in my room. My mom is very upset still and so am I. \n\nI really feel like a total douchbag but, i just don't know if it was appropriate of my mom to basically tell me I was a burnout and that I wouldn't amount to anything. Am I The Asshole?\n\nTLDR: I earned a scholarship of $4000 for flying lessons but, somewhat neglected school while working on the scholarship. Now my parents are not letting me use my scholarship because of my grades and both my mom and I really hurt each others feelings during an argument about it.\n\n\n\n\n\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I always say no to buying diet pills (no FDA regulation). \n\nWhen she sends me the various Instagram posts, it makes me really upset. I feel like she's sending them to me because she thinks that I am fat and need these diets and stuff. (Imagine someone sending you a ton of weight loss info with no context because that is essentially what happened.)\n\nToday, I finally asked her to stop sending me the posts because it was making me upset and I felt like she thought I was overweight.

It's not always about you.\"\n\nAt this point, I stopped replying because I didn't want to argue anymore.

One guy ran to the autozone in the parking lot to see if they have something to break in. I was ready to break the window. People were running over and looking in my car, comforting me, calling for help. I was hysterical and nothing anyone said made me feel better.

I thought it wasn't possible, but she assured me I wouldn't have to do a single thing I didn't want to. \n\nI thought it was a pretty bad idea, but I suggested a trial period where she stays with me, and if it works out by the time my lease is up, then we move into a bigger place together. She agreed wholeheartedly, and moved in.\n\nAt first things were fine. But one week, she got pretty sick, so I took care of her dog that week. Then, she had to go out of town, and I took care of the dog then too though I mentioned to her in the future, she'd need to make other arrangements. Things like this kept cropping up. She needed to go to work early, her friend was in town and she wanted to go out. Sometimes I refused, but each time I did, she kicked up a fuss. I tried reminding her of our deal, but she said it was only sometimes and only for \"extenuating circumstances\" and it was ridiculous to expect her to pay money to watch her dog when I was at home.  \n\nSo I told her when my lease was up, I'll be renewing it on my own here, and that I didn't feel like the trial had gone well. She got very upset about that, and started to argue a lot about how she didn't expect NO help, just not a lot, and her dog will live for at least another 5 years, did I expect we'll never live with each other until then. I told her no but right now I value the freedom that I have not caring for another creature. I also said if it changed in either direction, I become more okay with it, or I realize I'll never be okay with it, I'd let her know immediately. She didn't like that either. \n\nSome of her friends have pulled the \"wHaT aBoUt WhEn yOu HaVe KiDs?\" but obviously my kids would be  a totally different thing for me, and I've shut it down each time she's tried to argue that. Others think I'm some dog hating monster, which isn't true either. I know that this is a compatibility issue and maybe we need to just break up, so I'd rather not hear that over and over since neither of us seem ready to pull the plug yet, but yeah.

They\u2018ve asked all parents to continue to pay tuition so that they can pay the teachers, rent, and other workers that are not working. Tuition is normally $1500 a month per child and does not include any food. They\u2019ve started doing daily zoom classes for 30 mins but as all the kids are 5 and under, no one is really sitting for it, especially not my kids.

I don\u2019t mind paying some of the tuition however, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair for them to ask us to continue to pay $4500 a month for childcare we are not receiving. We pay that much for someone to take care of our kids during the day so that we can work. We don\u2019t pay that much to have them set up a 30 online class and some workbook that we have to be present for. we already paid for March (and they haven\u2019t been to school this entire month) and we\u2019ve already prepaid for The entire month of June even though they\u2019re only in school for the first week. They usually have 90-100 kids enrolled at the school (4 classes). That means that they bring in 135-150k a month. I sincerely doubt they aren\u2019t making some sort of profit at that rate and I think it\u2019s pretty greedy of them to want parents to continue to pay the same rate through the remainder of the school year instead of prorating the amount to something that would just sustain the closed school until they open it back up. \n\nThere have been some parents who are on the \u201cwe should continue to pay so that the teachers can get paid\u201d boat but those parents only pay for one child.

A physical description, medical history, professional background, a list of hobbies/interests, a childhood picture of the donor etc. \n\nSome donors are open to being contacted when the child is an adult. I wanted to find a donor open to this but I was not able to. I chose my donor because he matched all of the other requirements relating to health and was from the same ethnic background as me. That sounds bad, but I feel a strong connection to my home country even though I no longer live there, and it was important to me that my child be the same ethnicity. No other donors matched ethnic background AND my other requirements. Men of my ethnicity don't commonly donate. This wasn't a decision I took lightly. I considered many profiles. I spent weeks deciding. None of the open donors felt right. I don't feel positive about the closed donation. I'd feel unsatisfied never knowing or being able to have a conversation with a biological half of me but I've talked it through with a therapist and come to accept that my family can be enough for my child. \n\nI'm taking steps to give my child an idea of the biological half they are missing by making an identity box. I included all of the information I have on the donor in the box and my child will grow up understanding their background and the reasons they don't have a father. \n\nOne of the reasons I made my peace with the closed donation is that the bank promised a letter from the donor to the child. I thought at least a letter could give an older child or teenager some closure if they were curious about their biological Father. I received the letter last week. It really isn't a letter. It's clear that the donor was asked to write something while in the office for medicals or something and wrote on a scrap of paper in a hurry. It's a photocopy of the paper and the note is three lines in total. Without quoting verbatim it says:\n\n\"This is the strangest thing I've done but it's cool I get to help someone have kids! Good luck in life. I hope it works out for you.\" \n\nIt feels anti-climatic to me so I can only imagine how it will feel to my child. I was talking to a friend about it this weekend and I mentioned that I was thinking of typing up something 'from' the donor that was a little more encouraging or at least a little longer. I wouldn't change the essence of the note but I would expand on it so it didn't feel so half-assed. I feel terrible for my child. I know I'll provide all the love and stability in the world but there will come a time when they will wonder. I'm not sure what to do, but my friend advised me that I'm overly emotional at the moment due to hormones and it wouldn't be fair to fake the note even if my child will never find out.

Given this statament, \"AITA for leaving my door unlocked against my roommates' wishes? | For context, me and my roommates live in a small three bedroom house in Tucson,AZ. My bedroom is the master bedroom and I pay what they both pay in rent combined for it. My room was built as an add on to the house, so there's a door to our backyard in it. About a year ago, shortly after I moved in to the room, I was thinking about how convenient it would be to be able to come in through that door. A lot of times, my hands are super full coming into the house, it's the easier door to open, and the bed is right there when you walk in so I can drop everything if it's heavy. I am also one of those people who always forgets something inside, so locking the door is always a pain because a lot of times I'm going to have to unlock it immediately anyway.\n\nThen I realized, why not leave it unlocked? How much does a locked door actually deter a burglar? I did some quick research and while consensus is generally in favor of locking your doors, there are some people that leave their doors unlocked. I didn't see it any different really as leaving a spare key somewhere nearby. I've been burgled before, while I was sleeping and with a dog in the house, so I know that if a burglar really want's to get in, one small deadbolt isn't going to stop them. I decided to start leaving the door unlocked, and I didn't tell my roommates because in my opinion there wasn't anything to tell.\n\nNow, one year later, my roommates find out about it. They think there's no reason to leave the door unlocked and they ask me to start locking it. I explained everything above to them, but they did not agree. One of my roommates then proceeded to enter my room every day to lock it from the inside against my wishes. I'm a big proponent of not getting into fights with your roommates, so I let it slide for a while hoping that maybe he would give up, or maybe I would get used to it. But every time I had to pee, or the wind was whipping around outside, and the smart lock on our front door wouldn't open and I had to re-pair my phone to it, I grew a little bit more resentful. One of my roommates has a pet, even though that's against our lease, but I take that risk. And he's moving out in June!\n\nA couple of days ago, I locked my room's interior door from the inside so that if my roommate wanted to lock it, he would have to go outside and use his key. This started a rehashing of the whole fight, and now we're stuck. My argument is that the thing they are scared of is not any more likely whether or not I leave my door unlocked, at least not in a reasonable way. I am taking the same risk as them, yet I am not scared. The idea came up that I should pay if any of their stuff gets stolen, but then I am providing them with free insurance since there's probably not going to be a way to know whether my door being locked would have deterred the thief. Their argument is that they are not getting any benefit from this, and thus should not have to take any risk no matter how minute it is.\n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Some people on here suggested that I apologize for my actions which I read but that's it.\n\nI was recently talking with my good friend about the situation which means I still obviously feel bad about it and he told me the same shit, just give her a call and apologize for my actions.\n\nSo I did, the next day I grew a pair of fucking nuts and hit her up, talking for about a hour about all the shit that happened and it worked.\n\nWe ended up linking up, one thing led to another and now we are coolin it together on a regular basis\n\nThe moral of this story and why I posted it on here is to let all of y'all know that no matter how bad you think you fucked something up you can fix it (or at least move on).\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Her uncle died from an overdose of a different, more intense drug of this type (her doc does know this!). \n\nGiven all of this, I strongly advised by wife against taking this medicine. I told her that if chooses to take the med, that I will only support that decision if she gets a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist...

For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.\n\n\nI don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.\n\n\nWell, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.\n\n\nWell, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. \n\n\nWell when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no.

It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.\n\nAnyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her \u201cBut you\u2019re not Chinese. You shouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.\n\nI was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. \n\nA few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a \u201ctime out\u201d for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. \n\nAt this point it was affecting my daughter\u2019s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they\u2019re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.\n\nFlash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, \u201cWell Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.\u201d\n\nI was super taken aback.

Don\u2019t ask me how, I wasn\u2019t next to her. Her father took apart the piping underneath and managed to shake it out which was really good. She & I were both relieved. But over the past week she\u2019s lost it *three more times*. Every time it went down our bathroom sink & I\u2019d have to take a not insignificant amount of time to take apart the plumbing (which is nasty in its own right) and get it out. I asked her how in Jesus\u2019 name she keeps losing it and she says that when she does a toner scrub (pours toner on a cotton pad & scrubs her face) she accidentally rips it out. Now look. I used to have a stud so I know how easy it can be to lose it but I always made sure to watch it when I was washing my face. All it takes is a bit of effort really.\n\nSo this morning she wakes me up and tells me that she\u2019s flushed it down the god damn sink AGAIN. Obviously I\u2019m really annoyed at this point. As I\u2019m taking apart the plumbing once again, I tell her that this is the last time I\u2019m doing this and that she better watch me so she knows how to do it in case she loses it again. She says fine, okay, whatever. I find it and it\u2019s all good. \n\nGuess what happened an hour ago? Yep, she flushed it down the sink. For. The. Sixth. Time. And I say, look. I told you I\u2019m not going to do it again. I didn\u2019t say I told you so, or you\u2019re being dumb, or anything like that. I said that that sucks but I am not going to take it apart again. Like, she\u2019s got hands too. She\u2019s seen me do it so many times by now she should know how to do it.\n\nShe got frustrated with me and said I\u2019ve done it so many times so why not do it again. That made me laugh because if she really wanted me to do it then that would\u2019ve been the worst possible thing to say. She asked me to call a plumber I said no I can\u2019t afford that. She then threatened to call her dad to do it and I laughed again, like am I supposed to be scared of that? lol\n\nShe\u2019s just been crying really hard now & I feel bad about refusing to do it.

I say this to set the precedent that I don't bear any resentment towards her, it's just this situation.\n\nLong story short: Had a skin condition that caused ugly cystic acne. This and untreated depression/anxiety made my early teens a spiral of self-hatred and frequent manic episodes of screaming, sobbing, and locking myself away so no one could see how \"hideous\" I was. I put chemicals on my face, refused to let my own family see me. A mess.\n\nI  got treated for this and it got better.  I still have worse skin than my peers, but nothing like what it was, and my own appearance isnt a trigger anymore. Still, it can be a bit touchy.\n\nMy sister has  perfect skin, like natural foundation. We actually clown each other back and forth about it: She'll tease me about being jealous and having a \"54 step routine\" and I tell her I'll be the one laughing when we're 60 and she looks like a prune.\n\nRecently she's been having skin troubles.

He tells me that their busy as all hell when the owner pulls up and gets out of his car looking pissed as fire. As soon as he gets out he points at Jesse and orders him over to the car, hands on his waist pacing back and forth clearly irritated. According to Jesse he literally runs over to the owners car.

Long enough of a moment to give Jesse the thought that the owner just gave him the car. The owner then chuckles and says nahhh I cant give you the beamer but I got you something else, open the trunk and check it out. Jesse takes the keys, opens up the trunk,(Again I'm thinking to myself like...it better be a kilo of bam bam or at least 3 mac book pros in that bitch) and feasts his eyes on...a mf'n air fryer.\n\n Jesse is telling me this shit like he's the luckiest dude in the world, and I, somewhat regrettably so begin to dismantle every bit of his excitement by describing how much of an insult and slap in the face this \"gift\" from his employer is. I'm telling him shit like \"you should've thrown that air fryer across the damn street and told him to go fuck himself\" etc etc. My rant probably lasted 3 minutes and at the end of it I look at his face and he looks embarrassed and somewhat ashamed. He's not looking at me while he say's \"well I thought it was pretty cool I really wanted one of those things\". I again go into explaining why he should feel disrespected and not appreciated until I snap out of it.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA if i told my wife using a donor sperm isn't doesn't sit well with me | Throwaway account since my wife knows my name on here - long story short we've been married 8 years now and no kids because of me - there's a genetic/hereditary/whatever situation causing a low sperm count and weak swimmers among those that are there.  Despite years of trying, the old fashioned way just isn't happening.  Ever.\n\nWe've been dealing with fertility specialists for a little over 3 years now - early on we discovered the issue was with me and so about 2 years ago I went through a surgery where they removed testicular tissue in the hopes of being able to retrieve viable sperm that way.  After going through this we took some time to prepare ourselves mentally/financially for what's to come with my stuff on ice while we did that.  After meeting with various dr's and not liking what we heard we finally found a guy that seems to be a good fit for us based on our appointment yesterday.  Unfortunately, after reading the reports from my labs he has informed us that the vials they have from me are deemed \"rare/possible\" in terms of potential to retrieve sperm for an IVF treatment.  Because of the situation, we basically have 3 options\n\n1. Attempt IVF with my stuff, spending the $$ knowing full well that there's a \"reasonable\" chance of embryo creation but no guarantees.  If this doesn't work we then move to using donor sperm costing even more dough.\n2. Attempt IVF with my stuff alongside a donor sperm at the same time seeing what works and going from there.\n3. Skip use of my stuff entirely & just go with a donor sperm which would allow us to use IUI instead of IVF, a much larger percent of which is covered by our insurance.\n\nMy gut is telling me it's not gonna happen with 1 or 2, that me having a kid genetically mine just isn't in the cards.  Because of this, I feel like in the long haul option 3 would be the best for us from a financial standpoint, I'd much rather have money for taking care of a kid than use it up creating one.  \n\nMentally however, I'm not sure how well I can deal with this - I have friends that have adopted, have seen firsthand the love their family have etc, but I just don't know deep down if I'll ever be able to look at a kid that's \"mine\" the same knowing we share zero DNA.  And what hurts me the most about this is how desperately my wife wishes to start a family.  It's the one thing I haven't been able to give her and it kills me inside.  So while my instincts are telling me to take one for the team and help her realize this dream, I question my ability to feel true love for him/her and whether it's fair to bring someone into this world not 100% sure how I'll look at them down the line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I ask, WIBTA if I tell her that going the donor sperm route isn't something I can handle?

My dad gets to work from home, but my mom still has to go out to her office.\n\nMy school just started online teaching, and we've been getting a lot of assignments to complete. However, my mom expects us to make dinner basically every night because \"we're home all day\". That really annoyed me because yeah \"we're home all day\" but we have school work to do. I got upset and asked her why doesn't she cook, since she always finishes work at 5 pm and her office is like 6 minutes from home. Well, once she got home today and saw there was no dinner prepared, she got pissed and started screaming at me how she's so ashamed of us and how we're useless.

I refuted by \"why don't you cook then?\"\n\nFor more context, my mom is an awful cook. She literally puts no effort into learning or looking up recipes. My dad is an excellent cook. He's tried to teach her before, but she refuses to learn and complains. Before, he would cook for us almost every day, even if he came home late from work (he has a high demanding job so his hours range but he's home 6 pm the EARLIEST, sometimes as late as 9 or even 10 pm. + 30-40 minutes one way commuting).

So my dad is forced to make dinner at a late hour so he can eat. More recently, he would just eat fast-food before coming home because he doesn't expect dinner to be on the table. However, he asks if us girls are hungry and offers to cook something for us to eat because he's worried that our mom didn't make us a proper meal.\n\nI'm a good cook too (self taught), and I try to help out if I don't have too much homework to do. I did a lot of the cooking during the first 3 weeks before online school started, as well as baking lots of treats like breads, cookies, meringues etc.\n\nAlso, my dad does practically all the chores in the house, while my mom spends all her time sitting on her ass watching TV. \n\nSo AITA for not cooking dinner today and telling my mom to not expect dinner every time she comes home?

My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, something she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal.

They have been close their entire lives, and are only a couple of years apart in age (mid 70s each). My dad's on the spectrum and he often pisses people off like it's his job.\n\nHis relationship with his sister has degraded severely over the last couple of years to the point to where they're not talking any more. I find this to be a pity, but up until now they've both been in very good health, so I thought they'd eventually reconcile after some time apart. My aunt takes slights very seriously and when she decides to be furious with someone it's almost like they're dead to her. My aunt is extremely generous and kind as long as the people in her life actively appreciate the impact that she's made in theirs.\n\nYesterday I received a message from my mom (divorced from my dad) that my aunt has meningitis and is in the hospital. Also, my cousin has had to drop everything and flew a couple of states over to stay with her in the hospital. I was told explicitly not to tell my father, in all caps. I called my cousin this morning and talked to her about the severity of the situation, my aunt is falling in and out of consciousness and can't deal with a lot of stimulation at the moment, so no one can talk with her except my cousin and my Aunt's BF. When going through everything my aunt said things like, \"don't tell \"my dad\", don't even tell him if I'm dead\". My cousin tried to talk her down from that, but she was having none of that. She's basically staking this out as a final wish kind of demand and the family is taking the request with the utmost seriousness.\n\nI told my cousin that it would be extraordinarily sad if my dad was never given the option to reconcile with his little sister while she was dying. She cried, I cried, and then I told her I wouldn't tell him out of respect for my aunt.\n\nSo I spent the day struggling deeply with this knowledge. Eventually, after thinking through what kind of incredible betrayal of my father it would be for everyone else in the family to know about this except for him, and what kind of weight it would be for him to bare if she was to pass away without him even trying to reconnect, I called him. I asked him if there was anything big or new with him, and he replied like everything was great. Then told him that there may be something really big going on, I told him I couldn't give him specifics as to the who or what, but he's smart so he got enough information from me to follow a bread crumb trail that I know exists. I've already had confirmation that he's digging into it.\n\nEven if she won't take his call or my cousin won't let any notification get through to her, my dad at least deserves the opportunity to make up for past mistakes, and at the very least know in his heart his last action towards her wasn't tinted with acrimony.

My roommate blow dries her hair while I am sleeping (well, trying to sleep). I have a sleep disorder so I sleep at weird times. But she blow dries her hair at 9 am. Which is really early for me. \nMy side: she should go to the bathroom, I\u2019m trying to sleep. \nHer side (likely): it\u2019s her room too and it\u2019s not her fault that I sleep a lot. \n\n2.

This isn't standard where we live, it's an internal thing that they can legally decide, and it's due to staffing issues. They have us sign in with the exact times we pick up and drop off, so while we all work an average of 8 hours a day, with the commute we end up using about 9-10 hours of nursery time per day, and often run out of time before we can cover the full week.\n\nOf the four of us, 2 of us have Friday off and 2 have Monday off. We agreed that on Mondays, the two who are free on that day would watch all 4 kids, and on Friday, the other two who are free then would take over, meaning the kids have nursery as normal Tuesday-Thursday. It's usually done out of someone's house but we will take the kids out sometimes.\n\nMy cousin, who is child free and openly admits to being \"freaked out\" by young kids, had to come to the town near mine for some business, and asked if we could meet up. We haven't seen each other in person for a few years now, not since I was pregnant, because when we have made plans to meet something has always gone wrong, like she got called into work or my daughter got sick. I responded that I'd like to meet but I'd be babysitting and she said that was fine, and it had been too long since we'd seen each other. I don't remember if I told her there would be 4 kids there, but I definitely said I'd be babysitting.\n\nI told the other mum helping me on Friday what the situation was and she said it was totally fine if my cousin wanted to come by and she had no problem with it, and I knew they had some stuff in common and would get on so I told my cousin that it was fine for her to come by and gave her my address.\n\nFriday rolls around, the mum I'm co-babysitting with comes over, the 2 other mums drop off their kids, and then a couple hours later my cousin comes over. She's not seen me in person since I was pregnant.

Friend suggests we go into the kitchen, but my cousin says she can't stay and leaves within about 5 minutes of arriving.\n\nA couple hours go by and then I get a text from my cousin who says that I should have told her how many kids there would be because I know kids freak her out, I made her uncomfortable, and she couldn't stay which she said was a shame as she wanted to see me.

Her daughter wasn't there but people asked how she was. My aunt was upset about how she still hadn't got a job yet that she can afford the full monthly payments on \"her\" student loan which my aunt admitted was a Parent Plus loan so \"she's stuck paying it\". My cousin graduated a year ago so payments began late 2018.\n\nI've worked at a university so I'm familiar with these loans. Frankly they suck and my aunt is an idiot for taking one out expecting her daughter to pay it. That's something no one should EVER do. Parent Plus loans are loans in the parent's name the student has ZERO legal obligation to pay. This is stated in the forms she had to sign to take them out. Furthermore they have higher interest rates than standard student loans and accrue interest while the student is in school, unlike some loans in the student's name. My parents and I went over this while I was in college. Most of the loans were taken out by myself and I'm still paying them. My mother took out a much smaller amount in Parent Plus loans. She has repaid them. She never once asked me to do so.\n\nFurthermore if my cousin had taken out Stafford loans in her name she would be eligible to get the payments reduced based on her current income. Parent Plus loans do not have this option, even based on the parent's income. It sounds like my aunt took out the loan instead of having my cousin do it because that was more \"responsible\" than having an 18 year old do it. This is bullshit and if she had talked to anyone in financial aid at the university or her sister (my mother) who had experience with this she'd have learned this instead of taking out $30k+ on some uneducated assumptions.\n\nSo frankly hearing this kind of annoyed me. I told her I was sorry her daughter hadn't found a very good job yet but the loan isn't her daughter's, it's hers and the daughter has ZERO legal obligation to pay it, and this was all stated in the form she signed taking out the loan and if she didn't want for this to happen she should've just had her daughter take out most of the loans as I did and that I hoped this was a learning experience for anyone there who had kids not in college yet. She got very cold to me, and some of the other people kind of gave me a cold stare too and seemed upset.\n\nAm I out of line?

The biggest reason I want to rescind the offer is that he has pulled some bad stuff with money in the past. For example, one time we split a bottle of liquor and he thought I drank a couple more shots than him, so when I Venmo requested him, he demanded me re-Venmo request him the liquor minus $1.50.

What is relevant is that my husband and I have gone to counseling to learn to set proper boundaries with his mother and a couple months ago we had a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d with her implementing those boundaries. Since then things have been pretty good. She stills makes inappropriate comments or oversteps from time to time, but my husband nips it in the bud immediately and the issues seem less frequent.

She asks if we can all get together to celebrate early and she wants everyone to come so we can get pictures and share this day. Sure, no problem. We show up with cards and flowers ready to celebrate. \n\nWhen we arrive and throughout the meal, she makes it clear this is \u201cher Mother\u2019s Day\u201d and she was sorry she\u2019d be out of town on \u201cmy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA for sharing the reason for our divorce? | Gavin and I have been together for 10 years. 2 years ago, he began a stressful job with a lot of travel, and he went on a work trip with a married colleague ('Nicole'). When he got back, he confessed to me that he had developed 'strong feelings' for her, and she felt the same. He told me they had decided to keep talking 'as friends\u2019.\n\nThey kept talking for a few months. I knew about this, but not the extent. She felt guilty and told her husband about their feelings. He was irate. She and Gavin  (supposedly) cut contact outside of work, though I found out later that they chatted intermittently on an app over the following months--telling each other they love each other, etc.\n\nShe and her husband divorced. I stayed with Gavin, hoping we could work through it and concerned about his mental health. He was depressed and all of his family and friends lived far away. I helped him keep up appearances at work (he would have panic attacks and was terrified to resign, worried to let everyone down). I convinced him to talk to a therapist and helped him get the courage to resign.\n\nWe also went to a couple's therapist to work through issues and, if it came to that, split amicably. We decided if we divorced, we wouldn't share details or place blame. I wrote a letter of forgiveness to Nicole, saying, among other things, that even if they ended up together, I wouldn't tell other people when their relationship started. I've told my parents and best friend Gavin and I are \"having problems\", but no specifics.\n\nI got a job on the other side of the country and asked him to come with me. At first, he said 'no', then a few weeks later, said he had a sort of 'epiphany' and that he did want to come and work on our relationship. He told Nicole to stop talking to him. I moved first; he would follow a few months later. The long distance thing went well the first couple months. He was relieved to not be at his old job. Then, he started to get depressed again, anxious about being unemployed. He finally got an excellent job a few hours away from where I work, and I looked into flexible scheduling at work so we could live together.\n\nHe moved to the city his job is in, and, while visiting, I saw a notification from her. I didn't read it, but asked, and found out they started talking again about a month ago. Now, divorce seems imminent.\n\nWhen I visit their old company later this year and am asked why we are divorcing, I am considering simply saying \"Nicole\". Obviously, I feel pretty justified. Neither of them work there anymore, so I'm not costing jobs. However, it is in a very tight-knit (gossip-prone) community; she grew up there, and her family lives there. The community adores her. Outside of this situation, she seems genuinely nice.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I would be doing it to be vindictive. I know she is terrified of the idea of being labeled a homewrecker. Also, I don't believe they have physically cheated, if that makes any difference. \n\nWIBTA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA. Yes\nB. No\n",

Last week one of my sophomores (I\u2019ll call him A)started in right field, and I ended up pulling him in the 5th inning, the next game, I started someone else (a freshman) in right. There were many reasons I did this, the kid is not a terrific fielder, so I swap him for better defense late in games. The second game I only gave A a pinch hit appearance after he struck out twice in the first game. \n\nOn Sunday night, I got a call from a woman I did not know. She introduced herself as A\u2019s mom. She asked me why her son, who is a sophomore, was subbed out for a freshman, When the 6 other sophomores are playing. I informed her that the year in school does not necessarily mean more playing time. She told me that I was being extremely \u201cunfair\u201d to her son since he was the only sophomore sitting. And how he was probably embarrassed and I should feel like a jerk. She went on to say how hard he was working and how she felt he was better than the freshman. I told her my job is to win games and if she is unhappy with her sons playing time, to maybe consider outside lessons.  She hung up abruptly. \n\nYesterday at practice, I gave a speech to the team about how I got a call from a parent regarding playing time. I didn\u2019t say whose parent it was, but I encouraged them to explain the nature of the team to their parents if they didn\u2019t understand. \n\nI\u2019ve also decided I\u2019m not going to give A much playing time this week, I would like to get a look at a few more freshmen in games. I also do not want his mom to think that her phone call worked, I want to show her the opposite that if anything that call is only going to get him less time on the field. \n\nAita for sitting this player to prove my point to his mother?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My parents had been happily married for 25-30 years when my dad died on June 20, 2018.  At some point this past spring, my mom (52) started dating a guy (37) from work.  She talks about him a lot, and while things seem to be moving surprisingly quickly between them, it's not my place to say what she can and can't do with her life, and ultimately I want her to be happy.\n\nSeveral weeks ago she mentioned to him that I enjoy target shooting as a hobby.  Apparently he immediately went out and bought a gun despite having no prior experience with firearms.  I thought this was a little weird, but whatever, everyone has to start somewhere.\n\nHowever, last week my mom told me that he introduced her to marijuana, which is still illegal for recreational use in our state.  She said that they \"only\" use it about three times per week, which seems like a lot to me, but again, it's not really any of my business.  The problem is that I've purchased enough guns to know that the following question appears on the form when you buy one:\n\n> Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\n\nLying on this form is a felony, and as a lawful gun owner with a license to carry, it bothers me that he committed a crime like this, even though it's unlikely that the police will ever find out about it.  And not only did he break the law while buying the gun, but he's also continuing to break the law simply by possessing it per the ATF:\n\n> Therefore, any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition.\n\nMy mom has been asking me to meet him.  My younger brother immediately refused because he doesn't want to see my mom with anyone other than my dad, and I could tell that she was upset by that.  I don't particularly want to be friends with this guy either, but I was planning to suck it up and do it for her because I love my mom and treasure my relationship with her.  But after she told me about the marijuana, I just don't know if I can respect him as a person.\n\n**I want to be crystal clear that I have nothing against recreational marijuana use in and of itself.**  In fact, I wish the government would hurry up and legalize it at the federal level so I can start using it occasionally too.  What bothers me is that he committed a felony by lying on his 4473, and it's hard to see my mom with a criminal (regardless of whether he's been charged), let alone welcome him into my life.

I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job.

I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might as well have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I am pretty independent, except for the fact that my parents are contributing the equivalent of 230 dollars a month for my rent (in reality this means that i can afford to have a car) (this will become relevant later)  \n\n\nMy sister has two kids aged 4 and 1. They are generally nice, but i don't really want to interact with them beyond the bare minimum. Yesterday around 6pm my sister called me, and asked me to watch her kids for the night. Apparantly her husbands parents (my sisters in-laws) had been in a nasty car crash, and they suspected that her FIL had some sort of head/spine injury (idk the details), so they had been taken to the ER in an ambulance.   \n\n\nI told my sister i couldn't watch the kids. She asked me why, and i told her that i had to go to the gym, and work tomorrow, which was the truth. My sister lives 30 minutes away, so if i had to watch the kids i would need to drive over there, and have a really long commute for work. If i had to drop off the kids at daycare i might even be late for work, either way it would be really disrupting for my schedule.  I also didn't want to miss going to the gym. I know that it's a pretty minor thing, but routine is very important to me, since i am a pretty busy guy, and i had been looking forward to getting a good workout in.   \n\n\nAnyways, my sister got pretty mad. She is usually pretty chill, but when i told her i couldn't watch her kids she just said \"are you for real\". She told me it was an emergency, and that she really needed help, but i still told her no. Then she said \"you are fucking unbelieveable\" and hung up.   \n\n\nTbh. i felt a little bad, but on the other hand her kids is not my responsibility. However, this morning i woke up to some pretty pissed of messages from my parents. They live about 5 hours away, so they couldn't watch the kids, and apparantly my sister ended up bringing them to the ER. My mother sent me a long text saying that they had raised me better than this, and that they thought we were the kind of family that helps each other out. She also wrote that they will no longer be contributing any money to my expenses.  They didn't even bother calling me to hear my side of the story. \n\nAITA for blowing off my sister? I know that i didn't go above and beyond to help her, but i don't see how that makes me an asshole. If you look at it rationally, i didn't really do anything wrong, but apparantly my family thinks i should just drop everything with a moments notice, to watch some kids that SHE CHOSE to have.

She also gets serious anxiety when people give her Christmas gifts, as though there should be some sort of reciprocity. Instead of gifts, she has asked this year that people take time to learn something new, donate to charity, read about mental illnesses, and other sustainable options. The closest she has offered to getting gifts is smart consumables(e-gift cards, non-plastic wrapped items, time with people). A lot of the people I've talked to totally understand this and are behind alternative options. \n\nNow, here's where I'm struggling. My mother and sister are VERY STRONG in their love language of Gifts. Each year, we make an Amazon wish list and get a few things for each other so that it is things we would like to receive. It works for us. I talked to both of them and explained the situation. After talking with my sister about it from my understanding, she seemed to be set on getting me gifts(which is fine) and an e-gift-card to Lowe's for my fiancee(we are renovating our house, so it made perfect sense). I left it at that for a few weeks.\n\nWe had our gift exchange at Thanksgiving. I understood that I would be getting gifts, but when my sister came forward with gifts for my fiancee, I told her that they likely would not be accepted. Sure enough, my fiancee(who was out of town) did not take them as they were things she wouldn't use and they weren't what she asked for. I blew up to my mom and my sister, telling them both that they needed to find a way to get gifts that my fiancee would want. If we are going to go so far as to ask for things from each other and be expected to get some of the requested items, why couldn't they do the same for this new addition to the family? \n\nThe result of that was my sister telling me that I was a jerk for not understanding that she likes to give gifts, and my mother backing her with the same idea.

Her daughter Nicole is two years older than my son Jack. \n\nJack did fairly well in school but not amazingly. He was always well behaved and was never in any trouble. Unfortunately not long after leaving school a friend of his (NOT Jack himself) got involved in something very serious, and Jack agreed to help. The result was both Jack and his friend being arrested and sent to prison. They both served over two years but are out now. \n\nJack accepts that what happened was nobody's fault but his own. He's never tried to blame me or my husband for it and has taken responsibility. He has made efforts to get himself into work including getting himself professional qualifications for construction and maintenance work. Unfortunately Jack's conviction (possession of a firearm) is treated as extremely serious in the UK and as a result most companies won't even consider him, and the only employment he can get is for temporary agencies, which is OK, but it means he can spend days or even weeks out of work at times. He is constantly sending out job applications but either hearing nothing or getting rejected. \n\nNicole is the total opposite. Very clever, academically gifted, pretty and successful. She's a corporate lawyer, and Ruth is always going on about how proud she is which she has the right to do. \n\nWhen Nicole was a teenager Ruth used to tell me about how her and her husband Owen were called into the school because Nicole had been bullying other girls. She didn't think much of it and thought it was harmless and nothing serious, but it was serious enough that they had to fight to stop her being expelled at least once, and Ruth still insisted that Nicole was not in the wrong. \n\nThe reason I say this is that when I mention that Jack is currently out of work and how difficult he's finding it, Ruth shows no sympathy. She says that he made his bed and she doesn't feel sorry for him. She also called us bad parents who raised a criminal. I was fuming and shouted over the phone that Nicole wouldn't be where she was if they hadn't gone out of their way to protect her from the consequences. Ruth became very angry and said that you can't compare ''harmless teasing'' to what Jack did. \n\nI told Ruth that she was the bad parent. Jack faced the consequences for his actions and is making every effort to do better. I also told her Nicole didn't earn her success since she wouldn't have managed it if the school had succeeded in kicking her out. Ruth slammed the phone down, and when I told my hubby he thought while I had a point, it was better left unsaid. I disagree.

When we graduated high school, I moved 4 hours away. Last week I moved 9 hours away from my home town and where she still lives. My parents never taught me how to drive, and it's never been necessary until recently to learn, so I always went back to hometown via a long (expensive) train ride. I now no longer see my parents, so going back would only be to see her. \n\nNow, dont get me wrong, I really do want to see my friend, but spending $300 for a weekend visit is a lot for me to swallow. I can afford it if I scrimped and saved every penny, but it would be very difficult. I'm also an introvert, so the idea of being a guest in someone's house for 3 days with no alone time makes me anxious. \n\nBecause of this, I have cancelled more than a few times on plans (she has too, but less than I have), and I'm seriously considering not going to her baby shower because of the cost (I just moved and am sleeping on the floor because I cant afford a bed yet -.-) and the 9 hour trip. I feel like such a horrible friend. She has come to visit me (when I still lived only 4 hours away + they drove), and that just makes me feel worse. \n\nAITA for being a flaky friend?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Over the last year I've fought through a fairly high conflict divorce and custody fight. The process was ugly but custody and placement is shared 50/50. The court orders require that expenses related to the child are to be split 50/50. Expenses greater than $100 must have the consent of both parties before being undertaken otherwise it becomes the sole responsibility of the purchasing parent.  \n\nI live in an area known for long and cold winter weather. Approximately a month and a half ago I approached my ex about setting up our child with winter clothing while it was readily available. They hemmed and hawwed and eventually came up with a hand me down coat that was already a size too small. It is usable now but will not last the winter.  We were still without boots, mittens,  and snow pants.  \n\nWithin the last week temperatures have dropped sharply and we've received our first snows. It could not be put off any longer so I purchased the needed clothing. Hat, mittens, properly fitting coat, boots and snow pants.  The total expense was under $100.  When I presented the receipts to my ex, the refused to pay for their half of the expenses, citing a lack of funds. I am not insensitive to that,  and suggested that they pay me back over the winter as they're able. They refused, stating they didn't have the money and it didn't matter if they paid me or not- the clothes were already purchased. \n\nI was put off by this- the tone and tenor of the conversation was very much along the lines of \"what will you do about it? Let the child without on my weeks?\" I was further put off because difficult winters are no surprise here, and despite the proclamations of no money, my ex smokes nearly a pack of cigarettes a day and routinely posts about frequent nights out at bars on social media. I don't want to police their spending but claiming no money for necessary childhood expenses while spending heavily on vices sits badly with me. \n\nThe small coat my ex got their hands on will be sufficient for weekly exchanges and trips to the store- little else.

We both live in the U.S. I (30f) am American born and raised, while my husband (32m) is originally from an Asian country. He immigrated to the US for graduate school, and he now has permanent residence here. We intend to live in the US for the foreseeable future.\n\nBecause all of my husband\u2019s family is still back in his home country, we try to go visit them once every year or two. I love to travel so it\u2019s mostly a fun and eye-opening experience for me, and I enjoy learning about other cultures, etc. When we go, we stay with his parents, as is customary in their culture (and because they live in a major metropolis where paying for a hotel for two weeks would be prohibitively expensive). \n\nThe problem is that his parents abide by VERY traditional gender roles - as do most people of their generation in this country. Both his dad and mom had full-time jobs, but his mom was responsible for ALL the cooking (making three meals from scratch every day for the entire household), cleaning, and laundry (which also has to be done everyday). Even when his dad retired and his mom was still working, she did 100% of the housework and he did essentially none.\n\nThat certainly is their choice and I would never comment on that or look down on their way of life. The issue is that back in the US, my husband and I share all the housework duties pretty much 50/50. We both have the same graduate degree, and we both even have the same kind of job at the same exact institution, and we each make pretty much the same salary. This equal sharing of housework is important to us, since we both are very professionally ambitious and want to prioritize our careers.\n\nWhen we are staying with his family in his home country, his parents constantly make comments and jokes and ask questions about my doing the cooking, cleaning, etc. Even though we\u2019ve explained that we share the responsibilities back home, they can\u2019t seem to fathom this.

Our neighbours are a couple in their mid 30's with a couple of boys who are approx early teens.

As far as i was concerned this had gone on long enough so later that evening (once i had calmed down a bit) i went next door to have a word with him about it. I tried to be as calm and as pleasant about it as possible. He just refused to acknowledging that this was an issue stating that he had the right to behave how he liked in his own back garden and i should just mind my own damn business. The conversation ended by him slamming the door in my face. \n\nSince this happened things have gone downhill a bit between us. There has been no more farting but things have been pretty frosty when passing on the driveway. No friendly waves or words exchanged, just them avoiding eye contact with us. The last thing i wanted was to fall out with anyone but i just couldn't tolerate the situation any longer without saying something. I have recieved mixed opinions from relatives and friends.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA for not going to son's wedding?? | \n\nHere's a little backstory. My 29 y/o stepson (SS) was released from prison this fall after serving 12 years. His mom left him and DH when he was a baby and DH raised him. When SS was 14, he decided he wanted to be with his mom and took off for the East coast. Mom was a dopehead, which DH or SS didn't know, and she had SS commit a robbery to feed her dope habit.  SS was caught and given adult straight time. Mom walked and basically ignored SS after that. We live in the Midwest backwoods and SS was raised here.  SS is and was a good kid.  His mother's manipulation landed him where he was. This is important.\n\nA few months before SS was released he met a gal (B) who worked at the facility and they became \"friendly\".  As a result, she was fired and he got transferred.  All of this happened about 6 weeks before SS's release date.  He was supposed to come home, here, until he met B.  When SS was released, he moved in with B and now they're engaged to be matried in June 2019.\n\n B comes from money, definitely upper upper middle class at least.  SS is was raised in the backwoods until age 14 and spent the next 12 years in prison.  Polar opposites but they make it work. I'm happy for him, really, but neither DH or I care much for B.  She's too uppity.\n\nSS has put me in the position of getting to DH to their wedding.  DH is really butt hurt over SS's decision to stay with B and wants nothing to do with her.  I've told DH he needs to suck it up and be there for his son.  I can convince DH to go but I'm having second thoughts now.\n\nB and her people are way out of our league. We would stand out like a shit stain on a white sheet and from what we've seen from B so far, it would be pointed out to us. DH is a complete backwoods redneck with no filter.

I had to leave my oldest (14) with her siblings alone for a little while. While I was there I called my father and he offered to let them stay while the baby was recovering. \n\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t know how long I would be at the hospital. At most I figured it would be a few days. So I called my daughters and said to pack a few things on a whim because they would be going to be at their grandparents house (4 hours away I should add). My dad picked them up.\n\nThey only expected to stay for a few days, but during that time I decided to move to the same city as my parents. All of our relatives live there. After the emergency with the baby I thought it would be better to live close to my family members for times like this. \n\nSo I had my daughters stay with my parents after the baby recovered while I bought a house down there and packed the things in our old house. I had a lot to do and one of the things was to return all the old library books to our city\u2019s library. \n\nBut I realized they weren\u2019t in the house.

I know I have to go to the doctors for this, so I will deal with it when I am chilling and back home.\n\nAnyways, yesterday was our last full day of our trip. My legs were starting to hurt and I still wanted to pick up some souvenirs for some coworkers, so I asked my niece (15 F) to pick me up some souvenirs (they were already planning on going last minute souvenir shopping), and gave her the cash to buy them. I think my mistake here was telling her that she could keep the change.\n\nI told her that I needed a specific keychain, a specific tee shirt, and a specific type of picture frame. She knew what I was talking about because we have talked about these specific items while shopping for souvenirs in the past.\n\nThe keychain was about $5, the tee shirt was about $15, and the frame was about $12 (I could kind of remember the prices). So I sent my niece with $40 so she would be able to cover it, with taxes and errors and all. \n\nWhen she comes back, I notice that she got me items that were slightly different from what I asked for. I didn\u2019t get upset because beggars can\u2019t be choosers right? She did me a favor so I wasn\u2019t going to be too upset about it. When I looked closely, I noticed that she picked up very cheap versions of the items that I requested. The keychain was $2, the shirt was $6, and the frame was $7. Doing the math as I\u2019m typing this, the change she would have pocketed from what I requested would have been about $8. The change she pocketed from getting me cheaper items was about $25. I\u2019d also like to point out the fact that I knew that they went to the store where I requested my 2 of my original items because one of my family members was carrying a bag from that shop.\n\nI asked my niece if they were sold out of what I asked for, and she said no, but she found similar items that were cheaper at another store. I clarified with her that she was able to buy the specific items I requested with the money I sent her with, and she said yes. I said something along the lines of \u201cwell was it really your call to get me something cheaper with my own money?\u201d. She admitted that she just wanted to pocket a little bit extra and I dropped it because I didn\u2019t want to start family drama, but I was a little disappointed because I had to give cheaper souvenirs to some people, which I\u2019m not sure if they would notice, but still.

A few days after, Oma gave me Ring M. It\u2019s her own engagement ring and she said meant to pass it down to the wife of her oldest grandchild, but since Oma never liked Rob\u2019s older brothers\u2019s ex-wife, she didn\u2019t give her Ring M when they got married. Oma said she now wanted me to have her ring. \n\nI declined at first and told Oma that I\u2019d already been given so much as I already have Ring R. I suggested giving Ring M to Rob's older brother Ric so he could pass it on to the future wife of his oldest son, but Oma reiterated that she wanted me to have Ring R because she said she knows I will take care of it. At that point Rob and I had been dating for seven years, his family treated me like their own and Oma was like my own grandmother. So I thanked her and accepted Ring M.\n\nRob and I were supposed to get married in June 2018, however Oma died that January.

I didn\u2019t hear anything about it for the next few months, but last week Rob called my mother and asked her to tell me to return Ring M. Rob said that Oma gave me the ring because she thought I was going to be his wife, and since we broke up, I should give the ring back. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do it and I don\u2019t think I should.

If Ring M staying in the family was Oma\u2019s priority, then she could have listened to my suggestion and given Ring M to Ric to save for his children, but she chose to give it to me.

I said I would pay for the dog as a birthday present as my mother has had to use a lot of her savings on medical expenses and I have a well paying job and still live at home so don\u2019t pay as much rent as I would do if I was on my own. The total cost of the puppy is \u00a31,500 because it\u2019s a very small, desirable dog. \nThe issue is we were discussing names and when she made her list of names she liked I liked all of them apart from one name which isn\u2019t even a name anybody has ever used for a dog and sounds stupid. This is the name she has decided she wants to call the dog. I said to her I don\u2019t like the name and since I will end up walking it because I work from home a lot I don\u2019t feel comfortable calling out the name because it\u2019s stupid.

I was confused, and tried to figure out why she said that and what she meant, but I was met with a rather Hostile response when she stated that what I had called them wasn't the appropriate name for them. I retaliated with the fact that I didn't know there was another name for them. this continued until the rest of the family intervened, but (IMO) were extremely One-sided with their judgment, saying that I shouldn't have continued the argument and that I should have accepted that I was wrong, even though it was clear I wasn't defending what I had called them.

My partner and I notified our landlord of a continuing situation and this morning we found out the neighbor had been evicted.\n\nThe new neighbor, we'll call Janet, moved in sometime in October. Shortly after moving in, she had a housewarming party. It went late, it was loud, and we began smelling cigarette smoke coming up through the floor. Smoking inside and on the property is a violation of the lease. My partner and I went down around 1 AM (this was a weekday and we both had to work the next day) and knocked on the door. She answered and we asked if they could keep the noise down and to stop smoking inside. She apologized, the noise level went down, and the indoor smoking stopped. That weekend our landlord asked if there were any problems with the new neighbor. We mentioned the cigarettes because our kitchen still smelled like cigarettes (we're non-smokers). He apologized and told us he would warn the neighbor. Since that warning, there was no more smoke, just the occasional \"normal neighbor noise\" i.e. TV noise, guests talking a little loud - nothing we couldn't ignore/drown out.\n\nFlash forward to around Christmas. A woman with 2 children under the age of 3 (I'm guessing) shows up and begins moving in (full on with a bed, clothes, furniture, etc) with Janet. This is also in violation of the lease.

Not only that, the mother of the children would scream at her children when they would cry (which was often) and tell them that she would \"kick their f\\*cking asses\" \"beat the sh\\*t out of them\" and my partner was home once and heard the mother scream that she would \"f\\*cking kill\" her child if it didn't stop crying.\n\nWe informed our landlord of these threats to the kids and they were both evicted.

So, here goes: (Thanks in advance for your comments and candor.)\n\nMy parents are going to retire in the next two years and my Mom used to joke about moving to a retirement community at least six states away -- it would take a 2.5 hour plane flight to go there. Recently, she and my Dad took a trip down there to \"explore the possibilities\". When they got back it turned out that they bought a plot of land at a particular development and were very excited to tell me and my brother.\n\nMy brother said one positive sentence about how he is happy that they are happy. I tend to be more critical about everything and so I ask them what made them want to move to the retirement community.\n\nMy mother tells me that she really wants to be part of a community, but I counter that in our hometown, which has a very active PTA, Boy/Girl Scout Groups, Parents who Chaperone Field Trips, Religious Center Sisterhoods, etc. she never took the initiative to be part of those groups. She responds that this is because she was the primary breadwinner and worked hard to give us a good life (completely true), but my caveat is that if people really want something, they make it happen.\n\nMy father tells me that he really wants to get back in shape, but whenever Mom or I invite him to join us on a 3 mile walk, he backs out because that would wind him. I point out that if he can't do that minimal level of exercise here, why does he think the retirement community would be better. He doesn't have an answer.\n\nConsidering that I have found my parents reasons wanting and they have not realized how connected they are to the family and friendship networks that we have in our hometown, I have remained critical of the move. My parents are irked that I continue to not support their decision as they have started to build their house in the retirement community.\n\nWhen their friends and our family ask me how I feel about this change, I give my honest opinion as I have here in this thread and that bothers them, too. They have told me to keep my opinions to myself and be dishonest about how I feel about their upcoming move when talking outside of our immediate family. They have also insinuated that some of this may come from a fear of them \"abandoning me\", but after serious introspection (because it could be a possibility), I have concluded that this is not the source of the problem, but the specific considerations I outlined (1) that their reasons for moving do not match their historical preferences and (2) that they undervalue the loss of their current family and friendship networks.

I don't see a sign or anything, so I ask him:\n\n\"What's the difference if I walk outside, drink from my water bottle, and walk right back in?\"\n\nHe just repeats again that no outside food or drink is allowed in here.

I wanted other people\u2019s opinions before we committed to the fight that this will ultimately be. \n\nA few months ago (February) MiL discovered she had cockroaches. They were just babies at the time, and it was only two they found even though they cleaned the whole house. So she told us they were gone, and considering they\u2019d cleaned the whole house and only found those two, we believed her. \n\nLast week we were at her house and there was a HUGE cockroach on her wall. She just shrugged and squished it, going \u201cIdk where they keep coming from!\u201d SO and I believe they are living in her walls, and are now past the baby phase, and she\u2019ll likely be infested with them soon enough. We didn\u2019t mention anything, but took the baby things we had stored there out ASAP. \n\nNow we\u2019re in the position where we don\u2019t want the baby down to her house at all until we know the cockroaches are gone.. but we\u2019ll never really know. She\u2019d easily lie to us and say that they\u2019re gone so she can see the baby. We considered paying half to have a professional come in and get rid of them, but the issue is they don\u2019t clean their house often. Dishes are often left out, along with food, FIL has done some half assed repair jobs (newspaper in the wall to patch a hole, near a sink, perfect moist conditions for cockroaches). So if we pay the money to have it done, they\u2019ll inevitably end up with them again. \n\nWe\u2019re thinking of telling her the baby won\u2019t be going to her house - she\u2019s more than welcome to come to ours. But if she wants overnights/spend time with the baby at her house, she needs to sell the house, and move to an area that has less bugs in general (she lives in the poorer part of the city, bedbugs and cockroaches are an issue in that area). We don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s too bad of a compromise - she\u2019s talked about selling her house before. \n\nSo basically, WIBTA for basically telling her that if she wants the baby to go to her house, she needs to sell it and get a new one?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for not wanting my dog to always be in my room with me? | Just for clarity, I love my dog to death and he's a sweetheart. We sleep in the same bed on most days and I honestly find comfort in that.\n\nHere's the reasoning for this post. I am roommates with my sister and we work sort of opposite schedules. Most nights, I work 7p to 7a and most days, she works 7a to 330p with a 10a to 7p shift about twice a week. \n\nWhen I get home from work, my sister is already gone, so I do my morning/pre sleep routine and grab the pooch before going to bed and we go to sleep for  most of the day, for which he's normally pretty chill about and let's me sleep until I wake up.\n\nOnly sometimes, my sleeping overlaps when my sister gets home and when he hears her come through the door, he goes bonkers with excitement. He's a small dog, a silky terrier, but he does it all. Barking, whining, jumping off the bed, vaulting off my back, basically ensuring I wake up long enough to open my door and let him go greet my sister before closing my door again and going back to sleep.\n\nI can't sleep with my door open. Even if someone opens it while I'm asleep, I tend to wake up almost immediately because the feeling is off. The bad thing is, my doorknob is broken so it can't lock and my little dog can push it open with relative ease. If I try to ignore the door opening to sleep some more before work, he's whining and scratching at the bottom of my bed to be let on. If I try to block my door so he stays out with my sister, he is scratching and whining at my door loudly until I get up to bring him back inside and on my bed. No guarantee he'll stay on my bed because he may jump down to sniff around and then whine to come back up.\n\nI have asked my sister a lot to keep him entertained while I sleep. Or, at the very least, keep an eye on him. She will for a little while before just sitting on her phone or her laptop at the other end of the house while he comes back to my door again and she typically says 'she didn't realize he left the room'. Especially this on the weekends when I still have to work but she's off and he wants to do this 'wake up' routine earlier when he hears her moving around. Honestly, it makes me frustrates when I try to rest before work but have him constantly trying to wake me up.\n\nLike I said, I dearly love my dog, but AITA for getting frustrated about this? It's almost every day this happens and I just want my sleep sometimes. But I still feel guilty because I know he constantly wants to be near me or my sister but still.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA. Yes\nB. No\n",

His parents, and him funnily enough, aren't super strict Muslims, but they follow the holy book, pray, etc.  Whenever we hang out, either I pick him up or he comes to my house and I drive from there.

He would tell me that I would never be able to outrun him so I shouldn't try, he would scream and curse and tell me he hated me, he would cry and say I was all he had in this world. He bit me, threw rocks at me because the thought I was talking to other guys. Quit his job, which forced me to work 2 jobs, 7 days a week to support all the drinking and weed and cigarettes. He hit me, choked me, screamed at me, laughed at me while I cried, accused me of lying when I tried to explain that he hit me again during one if his blackouts.

He got blood all over my car, threatening to hurt himself, to hurt me. Physically picked up Scooter and threw him on the ground. The last time Scooter saw him, he cowered on fear. I spent an hour holding the old dog and crying in the car after I finally kicked my ex out of my life for the last time. I told him he wasn't allowed to have Scooter if he was going to mistreat him. So essentially I assumed ownership of the dog with little argument from Steven. \n\nI don't want to break no contact and bring this traumatizing person back into my life. Not after I've gone so far in improving my self worth. \n\nBut Scooter was his dog so I don't know if Steven deserves to know when Scooter has passed on. Should I let him say goodbye? AITA for even thinking of putting down a dog that spent so much time not being mine? My normal isn't normal so I really don't know what's okay in this situation. I'm worried because it's getting colder and Scooters arthritis is getting worse.

When we're in the car he's constantly putting on Cd's he recorded of himself or playing tracks of himself from his phone. Then when we get back to his place he's always playing guitar and singing for hours and he seems offended if I don't just want to sit and watch him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if it was every once and a while or if he just wanted to show me something. But I feel like he just wants an audience and that's annoying. Last time he put on a cd of himself I told him I wanted to listen something different and put on a band I liked. He told me that this hurt his feelings and he feels like I don't like his music.

Given this statament, \"AITA for walking out on my date? | I'm posting via a throwaway account. \n\nThe past year has been very difficult for me. I experienced an extremely messy breakup with my girlfriend after I discovered that she had been cheating on me with a mutual friend. For reasons that I will not explain in this post, the breakup was extremely messy and resulted in me losing the close-knit friendship group which we shared. For some time, I was in a very dark place which I only got out of with the help and support of my school friends. My confidence and self-esteem definitely took a beating, however in recent months I've begun to feel a lot better about myself. Recently, I downloaded Tinder in the hope that I could start dating again. \n\nAfter a few false starts, I got talking to a girl. At face value, it seemed that we had loads in common: shared interests, similar taste in music and film, etc. One thing that seems particularly significant now (but didn't strike me as such then) was the fact that she paid close attention to my job. I work in finance and earn a high salary. Nevertheless, we decided to meet each other in person. I decided to book a table at a very nice restaurant, expecting to cover the cost of the date. I should mention, for reasons that you'll understand later, that this is the sort of place where people wear extremely formal clothing (suits and ties are the norm for men). It is also worth mentioning that my friends and I dine here quite regularly and thus are on very good terms with the staff. My friends were dubious about the amount of effort which I put into this date, but their cynicism did not dissuade me. \n\nSoon enough, the big night rolled around. Given the nature of the establishment (something which I forewarned my date about) I put a lot of effort into my appearance, donning a suit and tie. I expected her to do the same. You can imagine my surprise when, upon meeting in the bar, I found that she had put absolutely no effort into her appearance at all. In a room of smartly-attired people, she wore jeans, trainers and a baggy jumper. I immediately sensed something was off but pushed ahead with the date. Once we were seated I attempted to strike up a conversation only to get monosyllabic responses when she wasn't disinterestedly scrolling her phone. When the waiter came around to take our order she listed off some of the most expensive items on the menu including a \u00a3200 bottle of champagne. My patience snapped. I felt that I had been completely played. The only reason why she had agreed to come out on a date with me was to snag an expensive meal. As such, I pretended to excuse myself so as to go to the bathroom. Instead, I headed for the door where I met the ma\u00eetre d who I know relatively well. After explaining the situation, I paid for my share of the meal and left without so much as sending my date a text to tell her I was leaving. About ten minutes later, she figured out what was happening and sent a stream of vulgar and abusive messages. \n\nSo, reddit, AITA for walking out on my date?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I go there around closing time with another friend just to pick him up. My other friend asks him if he can give us some chicken tenders for free since they're really good at this place and they usually have extra. He's done this before a few times for my friend, but it's my first time. So we go in, and the waiter/bartender tells us the kitchen is closed. We go talk to our friend and he tells them he's gonna make it for us, so we sit down at the bar and get a beer each. Tenders come out (the bartender did bring them out, not my friend), we eat the tenders, everyone's happy. \n\nAs we're leaving, I offer to pay the whole tab, ie. Both beers we ordered. Dude hands me the machine and he charged us for the tenders, which were more expensive than the drinks, but fine. I give him 15% for bringing the stuff out. I know some people might say 20 is the standard but I'm from a small town in the Midwest, 10 is for average, 15 is for good here. But, considering the small order, I guess I could have given him 20%. \n\nAnyways, as we're leaving, my friend who works at this spot tells me that the dude told him I gave him a low tip when he gave us \"free drinks\", and basically that we shouldn't come back. At first I'm like yeah I wasn't thinking, I should have covered the cost of the beer or at least close to it. But I'm realizing now a few weeks later that I should have just paid for the beers, since the tenders were a gesture from my friend who literally made them for us, not from the restaurant.

He worries about her financial sustainability and even worries if he will ever be able to move out.\n\nNow here comes the AITA part: She has said to my boyfriend (not to me, but he has told me as well) that she might start asking me for rent.

With delivery this cost $312. While I was there I spoke to the driver and asked him about delivery. I was trying to figure out where I should put my tarp to dump dirt. He said they usually just dump in the person's driveway, and asked me if I was wanting something different. I asked if it would be a problem to drive it to my garden site, as the dirt was meant to fill my raised garden beds. He said as long as it wasnt through standing water and through gates it should be fine. Note, my property isn't flat and level but the area to my garden bed is relatively easy to get to, through 1 acre of mowed pasture. \n\nThis morning the dirt truck arrived and the driver that I spoke to was driving. From the road I showed him the location that I wanted him to dump on and ask him again if he thought that would be okay, if not, i'd move the tarp. He said it should be just fine, pretty much a straight shot. He unloads the dirt, and goes to drive away and he is stuck. It rained quite a bit this spring but we have been lucky enough the last week or so that it is dried out pretty well. No local flooding. Apparently 6 inches down in the yard was not dry enough. I offered him a couple of wooden boards to see if he could gain some traction, and he tried. To no avail. This was starting to put a few tire tracks in the yard. I was hoping they'd be minimal. The driver called his boss to come help out. At this point I had chores to do and went inside the house an acre and a half away, and asked him to call my phone if he needed anything. He said he would\n\n\nHis boss arrived in a F350, and chained the dump truck up to tow. Worked on the first try. As i was walking out the door to meet them, they drove off, without stopping, leaving clods of dirt along the road. I walked down to the garden site to see about 75-100ft of truck tracks, some 6 inches deep. The yard looked a lot worse than i'd imagined. What really upset me is that they just drove away without saying anything. Here are pictures and a short video of them getting out  http://imgur.com/gallery/9JTNwcQ\n\nI have only facebook messaged the company so far, to send them photos of the damage, and have gotten no reply. Though, I have a feeling they may not be so sympathetic because they did just drive away from the tracks without a word. I'm definitely going to have to buy even MORE dirt to fill these dirt tracks and spend an afternoon packing truck tracks. So I'm covering my bases here. \n\nMy husband thinks that this is my own fault because I was stupid and allowed a truck to dump dirt in the spring season because it rains. But if I had any idea this would have happened, i would have easily moved the tarp and had him dump from the road. I was taking the drivers word. So.

I knew that finances are usually probably one of the biggest reasons that relationships fail, so during the engagement we made a point of it to iron out what our finances would look like under certain outcomes, our views on children more specifically than \"I don't want them\", what we would do financially if we both decided otherwise, etc.. It was good to have these things set out then, we both got lawyers and drafted a prenup, and I thought we were on good footing then. We agreed that we would have separate finances and contribute proportionally to joint expenses like utilities, mortgage, grocery bills, etc.. For small things like gym memberships, Netflix, cell phones, etc. we are on the same plan and pay proportionally, but we agreed that major financial things like cars, health insurance, and taxes would be separate.\n\nThat had worked for us for a year and a half, but our agreement is now dying a death by a thousand cuts. Firstly, we had agreed on a fixed payment responsibility, directly proportional to our own earnings, but she argued that we change it 8 months ago. When we were engaged we agreed our responsibilities were 70/30 (97k/45k) and would stay fixed to the proportion of our earnings. But she argued 8 months ago that even though our income is 72/28 (180k/70k) it hurts her a lot more than it does me to contribute, so it should be 80/20. This didn't matter much to me at the time, and it's technically true that paying bills doesn't hurt me as much relatively, but it's been the first step in a worrying trend. This year she argued that we should file our taxes jointly. I was pretty against this, as that was one of the things we explicitly agreed to do separately, but to her, it was impractical not to, since we would both be losing out on a modestly large amount with no \u201creal benefits\u201d. Even though I wasn't for it, it was hard to argue for losing out on the amount we lost be filing separately without any \"real benefit\", so I agreed to do our taxes that way this year.\n\nAnd now it's health insurance, with a similar argument, basically. She has to drive \u201chours\u201d to see \u201ccrappy specialists\u201d that take the plan her employer provides while I don't have those problems, it would actually cost less to add her to my plan and have her pay the difference, etc.. Again, it's technically true that my health insurance is a lot better than her's and it wouldn't cost more than what we pay in total, but I feel like pretty soon we aren't even going to have separate finances. I'm having difficulty expressing my point to her since it's not necessarily practical, but I feel the principle is worth defending, even if it's not the path of least resistance. Of course, to her, it's silly to pay more because of \"my ego\", but I think it's worth having the discipline not to abandon an agreement the second it becomes slightly impractical. \n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA if I kept ignoring my ex + refusing to talk to him about why our relationship ended? | 4.5 yrs ago I met my ex and instantly fell for him - mostly we had an amazing relationship for 3.5 yrs. Last summer I moved away for college 6hrs from him and till the beginning of this yr things were good. Then in Jan of this yr he had a mental health crisis/breakdown which was v difficult for me and gave me some doubts about us. He's said to me since, that during this time he felt dissasociated and he doesn't remember most of it which I believe. I didn't come back home to visit him bc I was busy with college (which I know he feels let down by since when he lived in a different city for a yr he came back frequently when I went through going to court to get my estranged dad convicted of harrassment - that's relevant later). After 6 weeks I told him on the phone I wasn't happy with things and was considering ending things and it seemed to flick a switch in his brain - he asked me to give him a chance to fix his mental health and we could work things out when i was back for holidays a month later. I agreed, and for the few weeks following we took space and didn't talk much and he started to turn things around.\n\nThen before the holidays, I found out my dad killed himself. It fucked me up bc and obviously that became my priority, so a week later I ended things with my ex pretty abruptly - I wasn't in an emotional place to actually talk about things so I promised him I'd talk properly a couple of weeks later before I went back to college. However, then I had the funeral and it left me rly upset so I told my ex we'd talk when I was back in summer - he was hurt but accepted it. Then in summer I did see him briefly, but not to talk about what happened just to see how we were. I think we both put on a brave face bc we were both struggling (for different reasons). Not long after, he called me and said he'd been rly patient and asked if we could finally talk properly about everything so he could get some answers + closure. Honestly the prospect just rly upset me so I told him I couldn't right now, and when he text me asking for clarification I didn't respond.\n\nSome other stuff happend like he came to my flat at one point bc he was worried about my wellbeing, but moreorless I just haven't replied any time he's messaged me and we still haven't spoken. He doesn't do it frequently, last I heard before this week was 3.5 months ago he said he accepted I was still too emotional to talk so he'd contact me in a few months. He msgd me again this week asking where I was at and I've yet to respond bc I find the idea of talking things through with him upsetting.\n\nSome mates think I'm being an asshole bc we had a long relationship and he's waited more than 6 months for what I did initially promise him, and they say I'm prioritising my dislike for one conversation over what has prob been months of confusion for him.

I'd often look at her jewelry box/ chest and what was in it. After my mom and grandmother died in that house, my grampy just left the house abandoned. He then thought he was dying of cancer, but he survived. During the time of when he thought he was gonna die, he gave the house to my uncle. So my uncle moves in w/ his family (wife and 3 kids). They renovated the house and everything. I asked him about my mom's belongings and some stuff that i had in that house. He just said \"it all had to be thrown away.\" I was very hurt by that, but understood that that was probably the case. However, i went into the basement there and found all kinds of furniture and pictures there (I'm very into history and genealogy, considering the fact that i hardly know that side of my family). I ask him if i can look at that stuff he says yeah sure. A few years later, i go into my cousin's room (my mom's room, where she died.) and i see the familiar jewelry box/ chest from my childhood... that i know is my mom's. I then become very overwhelmed with sadness and anger... i didn't show it, but i was severely hurt. Also, a year or 2 later my other cousin, said yeah these were all your mom's stuff.

Usually, we'd interact often throughout the day but in November, I started getting left on delivered (like being left on read, but the read receipts aren't on; more insidious imo) more and more often, and on the rare chance that she would respond, it would be one word answers. I was increasingly concerned because her social media was barren, which was unusual. She struggles with mental health issues that are currently untreated due to her financial situation. She can isolate herself when she's feeling down, but my friends and I intervene and help her when it happens.\n\nSo in the middle of December, she texted our group chat and asked us to go out to dinner to catch up. Of course I was in there like swimwear, but when I got there she was making next to no eye-contact with me, barely talking, and not laughing at my jokes all while literally sitting next to me. Fast-forward two weeks, I'm still texting her every day or so and still being ignored. Later, I broke up with my long-term bf. It hurt as we were gearing up to move out together and I reached out to her and got silence. This hurt as every time she'd have a break up or a guy problem, it was me who'd get the call at 12 or 1 in the morning (the sadboi hours, as you may already know) and be with her. But when I finally need her? Silence. I later saw on a mutual friend's instagram post her living it up at a NYE party. I was enraged.\n\nYesterday, I lost it. I went over to her house and knocked on the door, and a male relative answered and told me she wasn't home. I went home and called her job. It rang and her coworker picked up, and I asked to talk to her. She asked me who I was and I said \"her sister\". So the call was transferred to Nina, and I was like \"it's not your sister, it's me, why are you avoiding me\" and I cried on the phone. She was upset and said \"you can't call me at work for this, it isn't that important, I could have gotten in trouble\" and hung up. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, she texted the group chat (SHE FOUND THE TIME) and we ended up arguing. She told us that she wasn't ignoring anyone, but busy but I countered and said \"you weren't too busy to party\". I then said \"I'm mad that you haven't made the time for us\", and then she left the group chat. Now Reddit, I had a moment of pettiness and added her back in the group chat. I said \"You left because you know I'm right. Something is up and we're being ignored. If you really want to make time for someone, you will, and I see we weren't worth it\". Then she left the group chat again, and I didn't add her back.\n\nAm I on crackhead energy?

My BF (27M) doesn't really understand my passion for animals. He never grew up around them and has never had much of an interest in my pets. He likes them, but he doesn't want anymore. When we moved in together a year ago, I had 3 geckos, 2 snakes, 2 rabbits, a turtle, 3 guinea pigs, a fish tank, a parrot, and 4 hamsters. They are all rescues. My boyfriend has expressed that he does not want anymore animals, and I have felt like 16 animals + a tank is a pretty solid compromise. Although I am within my means to care for all of these animals and they all get loads of personal attention, I don't want to bring in more animals than I can care for. 16 is a good number for me at the moment.\n\nMy boyfriend does not like my hams, rabbits, or guineas. He will engage with my other pets, but finds those 9 to be absolutely repulsive, which sucks because they're the animals I have felt such a deep connection with.\n\nA few days ago, I got a message from a friend, who said that someone they knew had a hamster that needed to be rehomed due to health issues. I asked for some photos of the animal, to see it's condition. The hamster was in extremely poor shape and when I reached out to local rescues, they all admitted they didn't have the ability to properly care for it. The photos I received showed a lot of clear neglect, and I knew I had to help out.\n\nThe day after I found out about the hamster, I texted my boyfriend to let him know I was planning on fostering a rescue ham, and assured him it would be very temporary. I no longer foster since moving in with my boyfriend, but before we lived together, I was a frequent foster carer for cats, dogs, rodents, etc. He didn't respond, but I went to go pick up the hamster so that I could bring it into a vet. In person, I could tell it's condition was much worse than initially represented, so I rushed it to the vet. Once I had gotten there, I saw I had a number of texts from my boyfriend.\n\nHe told me I was not allowed to bring the hamster home. He said he would seriously reconsider our relationship if I brought it home. He was absolutely furious. I told him the hamster was extremely sick and needed the help, but he wasn't listening. I tried to remind him that it was only temporary, but he said that I was being ridiculous and I was violating our agreement. Trying to compromise, I told him I would have the hamster rehomed in a week. He told me that I could either leave the rescue, or get rid of one of my personal hams and swap the rescue in for it. \n\nI know I went against what he explicitly asked. I just couldn't stand to see this baby suffer. The hamster had to be put down at the vet, so he never got to come home with me.

I am white. \n\nYesterday, I was spending the night at my girlfriend's place. She lives in a duplex and has lived beside the same neighbors for two years. They aren't friends but are friendly. \n\nThe neighbors had people over and were playing loud music and we could hear them. It wasn't a huge issue but it went on past 10pm. I told my girlfriend that I was going to talk to them but she told me not to because they had actually come to her a few days before to ask if it would be alright for them to host a birthday party at their house, knowing it would go late and she'd be able to hear it because of how thin the walls are. GF is a hard sleeper when it comes to sound so the noise wasn't really bothering her. I'm a light sleeper. She forgot about the party when we discussed me sleeping over. \n\nShe told me she wouldn't be upset if I chose to go home but it was late and I didnt want to drive. I told her I was going over to speak with them. She decided to go herself. She comes back and they turn the volume on the music down and quiet down to a respectable level. \n\nMidnight rolls around and they volume has slowly risen back to it's original volume (the music stayed low but I could hear their conversation). GF doesn't wake up so I decide to call the police since they'd been warned. They show up about a half hour later. The flashing lights of the police car through the windows wakes up girlfriend.\n\nShe asks if I called the police and I confirm that I did. She gets incredibly angry and tells me that as soon as the officer leaves, I need to get out of her house. I ask her why and she tells me that she and I have had the discussion before that she doesn't believe in calling the police on other black people if no one is in danger and that, as a guest in her home, I should have respected that. She was also angry because she says I had the opportunity to go back to my own place earlier in the night when it was apparent the noise level that they had already cleared with her, was going to disturb my sleep. \n\nI told her I would leave but that she was being ridiculous and that if her neighbors couldn't be quiet after she asked them to then the next logical step was to get the police involved. \n\nShe refused to have any further discussion with me and, once the police left after making everyone who didnt live in the other side of the duplex leave, she made me leave around 2am even though she knew I had work this morning. \n\nI've tried calling and texting her but the only response I got was a text telling me that she needed to evaluate if she could trust me to take issues in her community seriously and she needed some space to do it.\n\nI still think I was right and it was inconsiderate of her to make me drive back to my own place so late. \nSo, AITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I\u2019ve maintained a laissez-faire attitude to it but my wife, ever since I met her has been vehemently against religion. \n\nAs neither of us are religious, we agreed we wouldn\u2019t raise our children (6m and 4f) in any faith.

The kids were probably exposed to the concept of deity by now, either through speech, or films or tv. Besides, in my view not raising them to be religious is not the same as completely ignoring the idea of god.

She always wears a huge amount of makeup even when she's just hanging out at home, wears high heels all the time etc. She's also had cosmetic surgery such as breast implants and lip fillers. She had all this before we met so it wasn't my influence. \n\nWhile I think she's beautiful, many people don't. She gets a lot of stares and comments in the street, particularly from people of the older generation but also from people our age and younger. Some of my female friends have called the amount of makeup she wears ''hideous'' and said that she looks ''scary''. Needless to say I've cut those people off. Even Molly's own sister refers to her as a ''barbie doll'' \n\nA lot of people assume that Molly is deeply insecure which is why she covers herself in makeup and had the cosmetics but that's not true at all. It's just her personal style. When we first started chatting she was perfectly happy to send me bare faced selfies without any kind of prompting from me. \n\nPersonally I think she is gorgeous with or without her makeup, but since being with her I found an undiscovered kink of sorts; The idea that I'm the only person who gets to see Molly's bare face feels super special and intimate, like she's saving a part of herself just for me.

She thinks that I ''encourage'' Molly to do these things simply because I always tell her she's beautiful. If she suddenly decided to never wear heels or makeup again I really wouldn't care, because it was Molly the person that I fell in love with, the way she giggles, smiles, the way her face lights up when talking about something big at work.

I just found out about this situation a few days ago and it\u2019s been torturing me. \n\nSo my husband and I got married almost 2 years ago. My little sister got engaged this year and is planning her wedding for next year. This obviously brings up conversations between my husband and I about our wedding. This week I was updating him about wedding progress and he mentioned that he wished the people who didn\u2019t come to our wedding (spouses of people who came and we planned on both of them attending)  would have let us know they weren\u2019t coming so we could have invited other people.

The bride was from another country. She came to the US for a semester abroad, fell in love with his friend, went home, and then came back on the K1 visa to get married so she could stay in the US. Their wedding was at his family\u2019s house and there were only 8-10 people there, including the bride and groom. They had the ceremony in the backyard and had an iPad up to skype her family in from her home country. After the ceremony, we ate dinner in the backyard and then there were cupcakes for dessert. If I remember right, they were on a 3 tier display. I made sure not to eat any cupcakes from the top tier; assuming they were for the bride and groom. All of the cupcakes looked exactly the same, they bride and groom didn\u2019t cut a cake or so any kind of ceremonious thing to get their cupcakes first. I was just told by his family to grab a cupcake for dessert. I grabbed one on a lower tier. Apparently it was HER cupcake. \n\nPart of me thinks that\u2019s an absolutely ridiculous thing to hold a 3 year (5 years at this point) grudge over, but at the same time just the fact that she has held it this long makes me wonder if I really f\u2019ed up.

My fiance is from Long Island and his family lives there, and my family is from/live in Vermont. The majority of our guests are coming from NYC. We chose a venue on Long Island partly because it was convenient for us, but mostly because we found a beautiful venue with an excellent wedding package that was in our budget.\n\nA detail that I think is important: my fiance and I are paying for the entire wedding by ourselves, with no financial contribution whatsoever from either side of the family.\n\nSince we informed our families of the details and sent Save The Dates, everyone has been attacking us for leaving them out of the planning. My family in particular has been complaining about having to travel for the wedding, with various members (my grandmother and dad in particular) saying that they might not be able to come because traveling is too much of a hassle. They've said I should've had the wedding in Vermont to accommodate them, instead of in New York.

Forgive any mistakes as I do not know how this community works.\n\nI am 47F and my nephew is 19. My sister died a few years back (god rest her soul) and with his dad in prison and no one else to really turn to, I have been taking care of him ever since. I never had kids of my own and dedicated my life to my career. When he came into my care I gave up a lot of time and energy for him. I had to completely realign my life for him and I was happy to do it. but with him, came a dog.\n\nNow, about this dog, I NEVER liked this dog. My sister bought it for him when he was 12 and it was a holy terror whenever I was visiting. It barks all the time. It constantly needs attention. It's a nuisance. Its behaviour has not improved since it and my nephew came to live with me. I have put up with it for 3 years now, and my nephew has taken care of it mostly on his own.\n\nMy nephew is now attending university in the next city over. The plan was he comes by on weekends during the school year to do laundry and get a bite to eat, and stays here in the summer. He does not really live here anymore, yes he has his room here still, but he is an adult, I am still here for him and help him out, but taking care of his dog is not part of that. And I am not home enough to give it the attention it needs. It made a mess of my house and I got noise complaints from the neighbors and I go on business trips and don't want to spend the money on a petsitter for it, when I don't even like this dog.\n\nSo, after he left for college I put up an ad on Facebook for the dog, and ended up selling it to some nice family in the area. They have kids, who will actually be around to take care of the dog. I let my nephew know over the phone, and I even told him I was putting the money towards his textbooks, and he absolutely went mad. Started screaming about how the dog was a \"best friend\" to him and how it reminded him of my sister (his mom) and whatnot.\n\nI explained to him that I wasn't able to give the dog the care it needed and that I had found it a good home. He continued saying he would've found somewhere for the dog to stay while he was at school and that I was some sort of \"witch\" for just getting rid of it \"like it was trash\" when I did no such thing, I found it a good home with kids. He has a life ahead of him and doesn't have any more time for it than I do. I let him keep the dog when he was here full time, he's a grown man now and at college, it was time to move on.\n\nHe is still upset and is trying to get me to take the dog back.\n\nI dont really understand. Maybe its because I don't have kids or pets. My sister was really better suited for motherhood. If there is an issue here I want to try and make it right, or at least explain things to my nephew in a way that will make him understand why this was the best thing to do.\n\nGive me your judgement Reddit.\n\nThank you.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

They, mostly Eve, asked me if I would be willing to do it. While the thought of getting paid was nice, ultimately I declined. They pushed for an answer and I said: \"I dont want to get pregnant and have to get away my baby. I don't think I could handle that. Husband and I do want kids eventually.\"\n\nAdam was upset but not as upset as Eve. She was really banking on me being the surrogate since my husband and I were the only ones on that side of the family that havent had kids yet and sort of brought up the fact that if we dont have kids by now, we're probably never going to have them, and that she and Adam have been struggling and wanted the baby to be from family. \n\nEve hasn't been replying to me and now I'm getting more and more questions as to why we havent had kids by now.

I quickly realized that we had reservations for every room, but those three rooms were un-rentable because they had been sprayed for bed bugs, meaning we wouldn\u2019t have enough rooms for everyone that was going to check in that day. I went to work at 5 pm and somehow no one else had realized this all day, so I was the only one that knew there was a problem. Me and the maintenance guy were the only people there. I quickly called my manager and explained the situation to him, and he insisted that we put all of the furniture together again and rent those rooms that had JUST been treated for bed bugs because we had no other choice. So the maintenance guy put the furniture in those rooms back together while I worked front desk, and we were luckily able to get them put together again before all of the guest arrived and they had to be rented. It was a big fiasco and hugely stressful, but we figured it out.\n\nI had only been in those rooms that had bed bugs in them for a few minutes, but tonight I was hanging out with my bf and he found a bed bug crawling on him.

We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth.

Eventually we settled amicably. He keeps his stuff and I get the kids after the school year, a tiny amount of maintenance(waved after I have the kids), and slightly more in support.\n\nAnyhow our oldest, 8yrs, delayed, autistic, was refusing to attempt to take care of her hair(she is very capable of at least brushing it but refuses). My rule, as I was/am a SAHM and always cared for the kids, was if they want long hair they need to try to care for it otherwise it gets cut so it is more manageable. This applies to my son too as he wants long hair as well. Ex sent a text asking if I was cool with cutting her hair. I asked why? He explained she suddenly stopped trying , giving attitude about it and refused. Her long, thick hair was becoming more unmanageable (note he and his g/f work full time). I repeated my rule for their hair and said go for it if she is giving attitude about it and refusing to try to take care of it.\n\nOn a call with my mom I let her know about hair hair cut. Didn't need her blowing up about it in front of my kids. This angered my mother and demanded to know why my ex was chopping off all of \"her baby's\" long beautiful hair. I told her he asked me if I was okay with it. She demanded to know why the hell I would give him the satisfaction of make his life easier? I told her my rule as well. She then tried \"But she's 8 and autistic and she can't be held accountable\". I scoffed recounting being 7,8,9 years old and refused to brush my hair until she cut it. she tried saying I wasn't autistic. I called her BS. My nephew is autistic and she holds him accountable for basic care. She then gave up mumbling about how could I help my ex out? Told her it wasn't about helping him out and about reinforcing the rules. Just because we're divorced doesn't mean the kids get a free pass to act like fools and do as they please. Better for them to see we are on the same page than them try to play us on each other. My mom thinks I'm an asshole for not making his life harder for everything he put me through.

Given this statament, \"AITA for making my uncle's fiancee seem fat in front of family and friends? (Repost: word count) | The backstory involves my uncle's fiancee (now wife) Annie and myself going shopping. Annie is around 5'7\" and slender and in her 40's, and I'm 5' and 125lbs and in my mid 20's. I'm short and fat on a small frame, so I'm big-chested and have a small waist with a fat belly. I know I'm fat and my family usually makes fun of me for being fat. It doesn't make me happy, but I've never done or said anything to be rude to anyone who's skinnier than I am, at least not on purpose. \n\nWhile shopping, Annie sees a top from a brand I like. She asks me, \"hey, does this look good on me?\" while holding it up to her body, and I tell her yes. She says, \"I wonder what size I should get. What size do you wear?\" and I respond, \"Oh, I wear a medium from this brand.\" She looks at me and says with a laugh, \"oh come on, there's no way you're a medium. You're a large. I'm getting this in medium.\" I suggest, \"you should try it on first,\" and she brushes me off and says, \"no, it'll be fine. I'm sure I'm a medium because you're definitely a large.\" I don't press her further, even though I know she's got a bigger frame than me AND I already have the exact same shirt in medium; she beelines for the cashier, pays, and we move on.\n\nA week later, at a family dinner where Uncle Eddy and his daughter and some family friends come over, Annie brings the top she bought and gives it to me. She said it was too small and didn't fit, and that Eddy's daughter doesn't like it so she's giving them to me. I receive it, go to my room, grabbed the one I already had, brought it back out, and showed her it's the exact same top in the same size. I didn't really do this to be rude, but I was trying to prove a point that she should have tried it on instead of being hasty. The other guests were hanging out in the living room and saw this, and Annie looked really embarrassed to be seen as \"bigger\" than me. Even worse, the weekend following this, I was invited to lunch by my parents; I ended up wearing the same top and Annie and everyone else ended up being there. It's a v-neck and looked flattering for me because I'm big-chested, but Annie is slender and small-chested, so it almost seemed like I was openly trying to one-up her. Since then I've avoided wearing that shirt, but I've also not seen Annie very much.\n\nTl;dr - uncle's tall and slender fiancee bought a shirt after asking short and fatty me what size I wear, I say I'm a medium but she insists I must be a large so she should be medium and refuses to try on the shirt before buying it in medium, only to end up with the shirt being too small for her and having to give it to me. I have the exact same shirt and pulled it out when she gave me hers in front of a gathering at my house, she looked embarrassed, and the weekend after I wore the same shirt and ended up accidentally seeming like I'm trying to one-up her. \n\nAITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now.

If you cant make money doing it your way im sorry but your attitude is too much and the lies have gone on long enough. Im sorry if you cant make a living doing high quality fully clothed cosplay but sometimes thats how life is, the people with the money to give dont want to see clothes. it sucks and im not happy about it but lying and putting down women who are ok with it is not an okay thing to do.\"\n\n\nshe hasnt talked to any of us since, its been 3 days.

I\u2019m proposing in about a month. \n\nMy friends and I are big fans of parties, they occasionally (read: all the time) feature excessive drinking and some illegal drug use. There\u2019s always people putting moments from the parties on social media. \n\nMy gf has a job where if she\u2019s even seen *near* people who are using illegal drugs she could be fired for cause. She isn\u2019t anti-drug or anything, she just likes her job. \n\nI had stopped attending these parties or throwing them myself out of respect for her situation. But knowing I now have long term plans with her and not wanting to isolate myself from my friends I tried to find a happy medium. \n\nI corralled my core group (7-10 guys I go back with) and said I wanted to throw a party but it would either have to be a completely sober activity or we\u2019d have to have a party with a phone check. They voted and opted for phone check. \n\nGf didn\u2019t love this idea but I promised her she could trust my friends. \n\nLong story short the party is in full swing (I\u2019m sober - important later) and I see one of the guys has a phone out. I tell him loud and clear to put it in the phone check like we\u2019d agreed. My friends admonish him too since talked about this at length. \n\nTen minutes later a friend clues me in that this guy is actively posting to his Snapchat story with gf clearly visible. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe someone I\u2019ve known for so long who knows what this girl means to me would jeopardize her like that after I stuck my neck out saying he was trustworthy. I told him to leave. He made some disparaging comments about my being sober that night and how it reflected on my manhood. \n\nI dropped his phone in a pitcher of beer and sent him packing. \n\nHe\u2019s (understandably) irate at the damage his phone allegedly sustained. Usually I\u2019d be on his side, but I feel like we\u2019re even considering the risk he put my gf at after several clear warnings. \n\nI know the party was a bad idea and I have to re-evaluate my circle of friends \u2014 but aita over wrecking his phone specifically? \n\n*Tl;dr I had a party where guests agreed to not bring cameras or phones in.

When a new (white) co-worker of mine heard me greet him by calling him darkie she looked noticeably shocked, and after the call ended she started to have a real go at me and told me that I had no right to speak that way. I told her that I consider myself black and she had the audacity to laugh at me and then tell me that I was white passing (I'm pale but I don't look white so I consider that pretty fucking silly to say) and then asked me if I was a quarter cherokee.

I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment.

Given this statament, \"WIBTA for giving up our son for adoption? | My husband and I have been together for only four years and I became pregnant within the first year of us dating. We had a beautiful daughter and despite the relationship being new, we were both confident enough in each other that we got married and haven't looked back. We have a very strong marriage and relationship. If it matters, we're both 25 and 26.\n\nI became pregnant again eight months after our first was born. We weren't ready for another child so we had a termination at 15 weeks. We told no one because my family is fairly anti-abortion. The only person I told, and this was a mistake in retrospect, was my sister. Who was understanding at the time but I guess she flat out told my mother. Our relationship with my mother was strained for a long time but I *thought* we reconciled and they accepted our decision then to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nThis next part will probably sound stupid to you all but I felt immense guilt for disappointing my mother by having an abortion. The unreasonable part of me wanted to make it up to her, and the unreasonable course of action was to have another child. I became pregnant again much to the delight of my mother and my unreasonable thought process was I was making it up to her. I expressed to my family we weren't fully ready to have another child but we figured it'd follow the old adage \"it takes a village\" and we'd get ample help from my parents. My mother flat out told me it's the right thing to do and she'd babysit whenever we wanted because she's retired.\n\nTo make things short, we had our second child, a son, and my family completely left our lives. Straight up moved away, closed their Facebooks, never spoke to us again. Before this, she said it's punishment for having the abortion previously and that we're not part of the family anymore and we're on our own. My support system went to zero in a matter of weeks. Even my sister was on board and ghosted us 100%.\n\nWe now have a 2 and a half year old daughter and a 9 month old son. My marriage is beginning to get strained. We weren't ready for a second child and honestly, I'm not sure we ever really wanted more than one. My husband works full time and I had to relent to becoming a SAHM because we have no support system anymore. I wouldn't call our lives miserable but it's close.\n\nI broached the topic to my husband of maybe putting our son up for adoption, so he can be raised in a better household. Not only that, but maybe our marriage would repair itself, our daughter can have a better undivided life, and we can continue on our original path of just having one child. My husband is conflicted and said to give him a few months to work on us and if we can make it work, he'd like to keep both children as he loves them both. But I think deep down we all know things are in disarray now.\n\nAITA/are we the assholes for considering it?

Given this statament, \"AITA For calling the cops on a group of kids smoking a joint in the parking lot | First off, I live in a state where marijuana is medically legal and decriminalized, so people thinks it\u2019s okay just to light up all over the place. I own a small business that\u2019s located in a plaza with a bunch of other small businesses, including a head shop. There are always stoners hanging around shopping at the head shop. A few days ago, a group of kids on vacation drove into our parking lot and were just hanging around, being stupid, taking videos of themselves dancing and climbing on the railing in front of my shop. I took a video of one girl twerking off the railing to send to the landlord because this behavior is unacceptable. That would have been fine but then I saw them all standing together and packing and smoking a joint in the middle of the parking lot! They hung around for a really long time, like 30 minutes, and I tried to call the owner of the head shop and let her know her customers were outside being very disrespectful. She didn\u2019t answer me so I called the landlord and he told me to call the police, so I did. I am all for legalization but the kids looked really young, they could have been minors, and I don\u2019t condone CHILDREN smoking. The police came, 3 cop cars pulled into the plaza, surrounded the kids, and lined them up for questioning. They were pretty scared but it was for their own good, maybe they will think twice before smoking a joint in front of my business again. Anyway, as far as I know, the kids didn\u2019t even get a ticket and they shortly left. The problem is, the owner of the head shop thinks I\u2019m a major asshole because I called the cops on these kids. She\u2019s mad I brought this kind of negative attention to the plaza and harassed her customers. She thinks I should have asked the kids to leave myself before calling the cops. But I didn\u2019t want to deal with them, and it\u2019s my right to call the police if I want to. This has now created a huge problem between the head shop owner and me and I told the landlord as much. She might be looking for a new place of business, which I think is a HUGE overreaction. It wasn\u2019t THAT big of a deal, I think she should just get over it and not condone CHILDREN smoking!!

Given this statament, \"AITA for refusing to change diapers? | I was a 24 year old male staying in my parents' home looking for a job. Before finding a job I was living free while helping around the house with chores; cutting grass, cleaning, etc. \n\nDuring this period my mom's friend was going to a different city for a few days. She has two little boys, around two and 3 and half, that she couldn't take with her. She asked if my mom could watch the kids for a day and my mom said yes. My mom was going to help another family member with some hospital stuff on that day, but it was only going to take like 3 hours. As soon as I heard about this, I knew what situation I was going to be in. My mom was kind of dancing around the request of me watching the two boys for a while. All I'd be doing is giving them snacks setting up their cartoons. Check up on them every once and a while to see how they're doing. An entire week before this thing even went down, I told my mom that I would not be changing their diapers. She didn\u2019t say you will have to but was also unhappy. It was left at that. \n\nLet me tell you a bit about myself. I find kids gross. Maybe I'll change once I have my own. I'm also a bit of a germaphobe. I wash my hands up to 10 times a day or every 5-10 minutes when cooking. After handshakes I immediately want to wash my hands. Whether sharing my computer, car, gaming controller, I think, \u201cis this the type of person that washes their hands after using the bathroom?\u201d Do they sneeze into their hand instead of their shoulder? When I pet pets I immediately wash my hands. Those Clorox wipes that kill 99.99% of germs are some of my favorite products. My family also knows how I am about germs, and they often make small jokes about it. After I cook a meal or something for everyone, my dad asks questions like, \"Did you wash your hands?\" \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m watching the kids and it\u2019s supposed to be 3 hours at most. Well, it's 11 and my mom isn't home yet. 12. Now 1.. and one of the kid's pants are wet. He's rolling around on the rug, sitting on the couch, and the thought of that is just excruciating. His wet pants are touching everything. I called my mom and said the kid needs a diaper change and that I wouldn't do it. Truth is, I don't think I \\*can\\*. She basically told me that I have to or the kid will get a rash. I was getting pretty angry, and the fact that my mom is the type of person that is always late everywhere just made me more mad. She was angry too and I hung up. \n\nA little while after that my dad called and told me to change the kid's diaper and I repeated my story. He got home at around 2:30 and pretty much yelled at me to change the diapers. I didn't do it. I left. My mom eventually came and changed the diapers. Both were really angry were pretty much telling me to get a job and move out. It wasn't a good situation to be in at all. Obviously I don't want a little kid to get a rash, but I just can't change the diaper of some kid I barely know, I'm sorry.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache.

I\u2019m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. \n\nOver the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn\u2019t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. \n\nOnce they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store.

It kept getting worse, and every time he\u2019d complain I\u2019d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. \n\nSo as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn\u2019t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. \n\nI did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. \n\nI\u2019d like to also mention it wasn\u2019t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. \n\nHe is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

There was never any formal conversation about who owned the drawings, whether or not I was giving them to him, etc. There were a lot of instances of the following: \"I drew this thing, he's not here right now/we're both fairly busy so I'll leave it at his desk for him to see later.\" Again, I didn't mind them being kept at his desk, and was glad he enjoyed them. It soon also turned into \"I drew this thing, I'm showing it to him, oh ok he's hanging it up.\" Soon after that, I'd draw something (sometimes with the intent to take it home with me) and if he saw it/I showed it to him independent of his desk space he'd take it and put it there. A little weird, but again, nothing that I was too focused on, after all, it's where the rest of my artwork was. Super casual, no biggie.\n\nThis coworker is moving on to a new opportunity. I told him about a month ago that I was going to take home the sticky notes (there are about 60 of them from the past year and a half or so) and scan them. He jokingly said \"nooooooooooo,\" and I didn't think much of it. He then said that he wants the originals, not the copies. I mean, I did leave them at his desk, but it's occurring to me that he *feels* that I gave them all to him, and that they were all made for him, when that was not the intent. Only about 10 were made for him specifically.\n\nI know this is a miscommunication that could have been easily avoided by having a conversation on the \"conditions\" of the \"giving/using/displaying\" of the drawings, but... Again, it just was not something I was focused on. And now I'm not sure if I'd be an asshole for suggesting that I should keep the originals that I didn't make specifically for him, when it seems like I've given them to him.\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA if I scanned my drawings that I let a coworker keep at his desk space, and then gave the copies back to him instead of the originals?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

Given this statament, \"AITA for finding my husband's parents? | My husband was adopted from a foreign country. His adopted father died when he was young and both of my parents are deceased so our family is very small. DH has never wanted to know his birth parents. His adopted mom has always kind of talked down about them whenever the topic is brought up, and talks about adopting like she should receive an award for bringing him here. I was also adopted and nobody ever talked about our parents to us that way, even though my parents lost me over drugs and alcohol. Eventually I did track down both my birth parents though. Now deceased.\n\nA few months ago we had a scare with an auto-immune reaction and became concerned for our kids. The doctors asked about generic history. I later tell DH that he could know if he called the agency and started the process. He doesn't want to because they gave him up. The area was in a bad way and I try explaining that he doesn't know the exact reasons why and reiterated what the doctors said about genetic history. I said we won't be around forever and both of our families are shrinking, isn't it great there are more people out there maybe wanting to know us and our kids will have a big family again. He says if they gave him up they aren't anyone he wants his kids around.\n\nA few weeks ago I found his parents. For medical history and for them. They weren't allowed to have another child and knew adoption would at least be a chance for him instead of abortion. I didn't tell him.

I said I know you're hurt but maybe they're looking for you too. He said that's what they get for giving him away. So I stayed silent.\n\nThen yesterday he started to piece together the bit about the picture. I explained it was for our kids, and for him and for them to have closure about their child. I said as a parent now wouldn't you be heartbroken if anything came between you and your kids that you couldn't prevent. I didn't think it was right for his adopted mom to be dragging his birth parents the way she does. That she did a wonderful job raising him and doesn't need to stand over people in desperate situations to prove it. He left for his adopted mom's and neither of them will speak to me now, which sucks because he has all the money and the bank cards and the car and neither of them will pick up so that I can take care of the kids.\n\nI feel like his birth parents deserved to know that their son is safe, and that they have beautiful grandchildren.

There were rumors about him being in love with me but I never heard/felt anything like that from him, except once at a nightclub when he was VERY drunk. We were just friends though, and I was never attracted to him in that way.\n\nA while later I started getting close with this girl Melissa.

So it\u2019s basically a first come first serve for seats on the plane.  I sat kind of near the back at a window seat because I enjoy being able to lean against the side of the plane to feel like I have some extra room. I\u2019d also like to mention that the row I was sitting on was empty, so only the middle and aisle seats were left.\n\nAfter sitting for a few minutes and waiting for everyone to board, a mother and her young daughter (I\u2019m assuming she was about 6 or 7) came to where I was sitting, probably because the plane was starting to get full and they were able to find two seats together. \n\nThe mother gave me a smile and asked me if I would mind sitting in the aisle seat because this was her daughter\u2019s first flight and her daughter wanted to look out of the window to see the view outside of the plane. I said something along the lines of \u201cactually, I'd rather stay here if you don\u2019t mind, thanks\u201d. I didn\u2019t give her reasoning because she didn\u2019t ask, but I didn\u2019t want to give up the window seat because I don\u2019t like it when the plane window is opened, because the light is blinding to me, and it\u2019s still an inconvenience when I look away. Two, I liked the window seat for the leaning thing I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe mom looked kind of annoyed but the daughter sat in the middle seat and she sat in the aisle. I kept the window closed and was pretty comfortable throughout the flight. Then at some point during the flight the daughter was like \u201cmommy I want to see\u201d and the mom responded passive aggressively by saying \u201cwell honey, unfortunately I can\u2019t open the window so I can\u2019t make that happen\u201d. \n\nMy friends said I\u2019m TA for not at least opening the window or letting the daughter sit there, but I\u2019m not exactly sure.\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

At the end of last season we gave her a choice: a) staying at the same level but no preferential treatment anymore (she could only train elements that were part of our level) or b) leaving our group to go one level higher and learn more difficult and challenging stuff. \n\nShe chose to stay with us. Even though I advised her (and her parents) to level up. As expected, this season she's won every competition so far and I can't think of anything to teach her anymore. In addition, I think it's not fair to the other super hard-working girls in our group. \n\nThat's why I sat down with her and her mother and told her that we wanted her to level up and can't stay another season. She could however decide for herself if she wanted to go 1 or 2 levels up. I told her it's because she's too talented to stay in our group and we can't teach her anything new anymore and it's not fair to our other gymnasts if she stays another season. \n\nShe was super flattered and happy because she wanted to learn more challenging stuff and saw it as a chance to get better, but her mother was mad at me for leaving them no choice and feels like I force them into things. \n\nAITA here?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.

I like making fun of babies (to the baby) and I got a bit carried away when I said to him \u201cOh my gosh, who is the ugliest baby, you\u2019re the ugliest baby!\u201d as I blew kisses into his tummy. Caroline instantly grabbed him from my arms and asked, \u201cWhat did you call my baby?\u201d I sheepishly said that I was calling him ugly and I apologized repeatedly as she screamed at me for calling her baby ugly. Lucas then comes in and asks what all the commotion was about and Caroline tells him that I had called their baby ugly and she wants me to leave. Lucas then tells me that it would be best that I left so I left as I didn\u2019t want to make a big commotion. Later on, my other friends call me and asks why was Caroline upset when they got there and why I wasn\u2019t there so I told them what happened and they told me that I was a jerk and rude and no wonder I got kicked out. \n\nI feel like maybe I went too far and should\u2019ve hid my true feelings about the baby.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\", is this morally accepted?\nSelect one of the options (without any explanation).\nA.
