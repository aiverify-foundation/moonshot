About this attack module:
This module implements the perturbations listed in the paper Is BERT Really Robust? A Strong Baseline for
Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment.
Configurable Params:
1. MAX_ITERATIONS - Number of prompts that should be sent to the target. This is also the number of transfprmations
that should be generated.

2. word_swap_ratio - Percentage of words in a prompt that should be perturbed.
3. cosine_sim - Minimum word embedding cosine similarity
4. window_size - Window size for USE
5. threshold - semantic similarity threshold for the universal encoder
6. max_candidates - Number of nearest candidates to swap words with

Note:
Usage of this attack module requires the internet. Initial downloading of the GLoVe embedding occurs when the
UniversalEncoder is called.

Embedding is retrieved from the following URL: https://textattack.s3.amazonaws.com/word_embeddings/paragramcf
