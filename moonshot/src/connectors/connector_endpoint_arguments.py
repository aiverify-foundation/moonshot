        Converts the ConnectorEndpointArguments instance into a dictionary.

        This method takes all the attributes of the ConnectorEndpointArguments instance and constructs a dictionary
        with attribute names as keys and their corresponding values. This includes the id, name, connector_type, uri,
        token, max_calls_per_second, max_concurrency, params, and created_date. This dictionary can be used for
        serialization purposes, such as storing the endpoint information in a JSON file or sending it over a network.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary representation of the ConnectorEndpointArguments instance.
