In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a custom cookbook via our web interface. A cookbook is a collection of one or more tests (or recipes). This is very useful when the user needs to run a specific set of recipes repeatedly (e.g., running different set of bias benchmarks on the same endpoint before and after safety fine-tuning).

Let's get started on creating your first cookbook.

Click on "Create cookbooks". 

![navigate to create cookbook](./res/create_cookbook_1.png)

Enter the name and description. Once done, click on "Select Recipes".

You will be presented with a list of available recipes in Moonshot. Select the recipes you wish to include in your custom cookbook and confirm by clicking on "Add to Cookbook".

![choose recipes](./res/create_cookbook_3.png)

Finalise the creation of your cookbook by clicking on "Create Cookbook".

![finalize cookbook](./res/create_cookbook_4.png)

Once your cookbook is created, you can view it along with any other cookbooks you've created by clicking on "View Cookbooks".
