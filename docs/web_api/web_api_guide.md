# Running Moonshot as a Web API

Moonshot WebAPI is built using FastAPI. This guide will help you get started and configure your environment.

To run Moonshot Web API:
```
$ python -m moonshot web_api
```

For instructions on setting up the Moonshot UI, please refer to the [Moonshot UI repository](https://github.com/moonshot-admin/moonshot-ui).

## Getting Started

By default, Moonshot WebAPI uses its own configuration settings. However, you can customize these settings by providing your own `.env` file in the directory where you are running Moonshot.

## Configuring your `.env` File

The `.env` file should include the following variables:

- `MS_WEB_API_CONFIG`: This is used to specify the path to your configuration file. For example: `/User/path/to/your/config.yml`.
- `APP_ENVIRONMENT`: This defines the environment in which you are running Moonshot. For example: `PROD`.
- `HOST`: This is the host where you wish to run Moonshot. For example: `127.0.0.1`.
- `PORT`: This is the port at which you wish to run your FastAPI. For example: `5000`.
## Configuring your `config.yml` File

The `config.yml` file contains several sections. Here's a brief overview of each section:

- `asyncio`
    - `monitor_task`: This flag determines whether to monitor tasks in asyncio or not. For example: `monitor_task: false`.

- `ssl`
    - `enabled`: This flag determines whether SSL is enabled or not. For example: `enabled: ${ENABLE_SSL:false}`.
    - `file_path`: This is the path to the directory containing the SSL certificate and key files. For example: `file_path: "${SSL_FILE_PATH:./web_api/certs}"`.
    - `cert_filename`: This is the filename of the SSL certificate. For example: `cert_filename: "cert.pem"`.
    - `key_filename`: This is the filename of the SSL key. For example: `key_filename: "key.pem"`.

- `cors`
    - `enabled`: This flag determines whether CORS is enabled or not. For example: `enabled: false`.
    - `allowed_origins`: This is a list of origins that are allowed to make cross-origin requests. For example: `allowed_origins: "http://localhost:3000"`.

- `log`
    - `logging`: This flag determines whether logging is enabled or not. For example: `logging: ${LOGGING:true}`.
    - `level`: This sets the level of logging. It could be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`. For example: `level: ${LOG_LEVEL:DEBUG}`.
    - `format`: This specifies the format of the log messages. For example: `format: "[%(asctime)s] [%(levelname)s] [%(name)s]: %(message)s"`.
    - `log_file_path`: This is the path where the log files will be stored. For example: `log_file_path: "/path/to/write/moonshot.logs"`.
    - `log_file_max_size`: This is the maximum size (in bytes) that a log file can have before it gets rolled over. For example: `log_file_max_size: 5242880`.
    - `log_file_backup_count`: This is the number of backup log files to keep. For example: `log_file_backup_count: 3`.
