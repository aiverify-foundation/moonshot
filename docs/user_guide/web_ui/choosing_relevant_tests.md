2. This page lists the cookbooks that Moonshot provides. Each cookbook contains tests of the same theme. Select the areas that are relevant to your use case. This is not final as you will be able to further curate the scope and scale of the tests in following steps.

    !!! note 
        Some of these cookbooks contain scoring metrics that require connection to specific models. 

        MLCommons AI Safety Benchmarks v0.5 (Requires an API key for accessing Llama Guard via Together AI)

        Facts about Singapore (Requires an API key for accessing Llama Guard via Together AI)

        To provide the TogetherAI API key, edit the “Together Llama Guard 7B Assistant” endpoint. (Note that you don’t need to select this endpoint in the benchmarking session.) If you would like to use an alternative Llama Guard 7B assistant, see the [FAQ](../../faq.md#requirements) on how to do so.


3. When done, click on the next button.

    You can also unselect cookbooks if you do not wish to run them. 

    Click on ‘OK’ once you are satisfied with the cookbooks to be run. The total number of prompts to be sent should be updated. (There will be a step later on in the workflow for you to run a smaller number of prompts)
